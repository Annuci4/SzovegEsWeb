waymar royce	What d’you expect? They’re savages One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces
will	I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life
waymar royce	How close did you get?
will	Close as any man would
gared	We should head back to the wall
royce	Do the dead frighten you?
gared	Our orders were to track the wildlings We tracked them They won’t trouble us no more
royce	You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse
will	Whatever did it to them could do it to us They even killed the children
royce	It’s a good thing we’re not children You want to run away south, run away Of course, they will behead you as a deserter If I don’t catch you first Get back on your horse I won’t say it again
royce	Your dead men seem to have moved camp
will	They were here
gared	See where they went
royce	What is it?
gared	It’s

ned	And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran Go on
jon	Don’t think too much, Bran
robb	Relax your bow arm JON
robb	Quick, Bran, faster
cassel	Lord Stark My lady A guardsman just rode in from the hills They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch
ned	Get the lads to saddle their horses
catelyn	Do you have to?
ned	He swore an oath, Cat
cassel	The law is law, my lady
ned	Tell Bran he’s coming, too
catelyn	Ned Ten is too young to see such things
ned	He won’t be a boy forever And winter is coming
robb	Lad, go run back and get the rest
will	White Walkers I saw the White Walkers White Walkers The White Walkers, I saw them
will	I know I broke my oath And I know I’m a deserter I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them But I saw what I saw I saw the White Walkers People need to know If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward Tell them I’m sorry
will	Forgive me, lord
ned	In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name
jon	Don’t look away
ned	King of the Andals and the First Men
jon	Father will know if you do
ned	Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die
jon	You did well
ned	You understand why I did it?
bran	Jon said he was a deserter
ned	But do you understand why I had to kill him?
bran	Our way is the old way?
ned	The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword
bran	Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
ned	The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years
bran	So he was lying?
ned	A madman sees what he sees
jon	What is it?
theon	Mountain lion?
ned	There are no mountain lions in these woods
theon	It’s a freak
ned	It’s a direwolf
ned	Tough old beast
robb	There are no direwolves south of the Wall
jon	Now there are five
jon	You want to hold it?
bran	Where will they go? Their mother’s dead
cassel	They don’t belong down here
ned	Better a quick death They won’t last without their mother
theon	Right Give it here
bran	NO
robb	Put away your blade
theon	I take orders from your father, not you
bran	Please, father
ned	I’m sorry, Bran
jon	Lord Stark? There are five pups One for each of the Stark children The direwolf is the sigil of your House They were meant to have them
ned	You will train them yourselves You will feed them yourselves And if they die, you will bury them yourselves
bran	What about you?
jon	I’m not a Stark Get on
robb	What is it?
theon	The runt of the litter That one’s yours, Snow
jaime	As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you You worry too much It’s starting to show
cersei	And you never worry about anything When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock One hundred foot drop into the water And you were never afraid
jaime	There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father We’re Lannisters Lannisters don’t act like fools
cersei	What if Jon Arryn told someone?
jaime	But who would he tell?
cersei	My husband
jaime	If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores Or is it the other way around? And life will go on
cersei	You should be the Hand of the king
jaime	That’s an honor I can do without Their days are too long, their lives are too short
catelyn	All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here
ned	You have five northern children You’re not an outsider
catelyn	I wonder if the old gods agree
ned	It’s your gods with all the rules
catelyn	I am so sorry, my love
ned	Tell me
catelyn	There was a raven from Kings Landing Jon Arryn is dead A fever took him I know he was like a father to you
ned	Your sister The boy
catelyn	They both have their health Gods be good The raven brought more news The king rides for Winterfell With the queen and all the rest of them
ned	He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after
catelyn	You can always say no, Ned
catelyn	We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber I’m told he reads all night
maester luwin	I’m told he drinks all night
catelyn	How much could he possibly drink? A man of his stature
luwin	We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar Perhaps we’ll find out
catelyn	In any case, candles
jon	Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
theon	It’s for the queen, I bet I hear she
robb	I hear the prince is a right royal prick
theon	Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick
robb	Go on, Tommy, shave him good He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair
catelyn	Gods, but they grow fast Brandon
bran	I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people
catelyn	How many times have I told you No climbing
bran	But he’s coming right now! Down our road
catelyn	I want you to promise me No more climbing
bran	I promise
catelyn	D’you know what?
bran	What?
catelyn	You always look at your feet before you lie Run and find your father Tell him the king is close
catelyn	Where’s Arya? Sansa, where’s your sister?
ned	Hey,, hey, hey, hey What are you doing with that on?
arya	Move
ned	Your Grace
robert	You’ve got fat
robert	Cat
catelyn	Your Grace
robert	Nine years Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
ned	Guarding the North for you, Your Grace Winterfell is yours
arya	Where’s the Imp?
sansa	Will you shut up?
robert	Who have we here? You must be Robb My, you’re a pretty one Your name is?
arya	Arya
robert	Ooh Show us your muscles You’ll be a soldier
arya	That’s Jaime Lannister The queen’s twin brother
sansa	Would you please shut up
ned	My queen
catelyn	My queen
robert	Take me to your crypt I want to pay my respects
cersei	We’ve been riding for a month, my love Surely the dead can wait
robert	Ned
arya	Where’s the Imp?
cersei	Where is our brother? Go find the little beast
ned	Tell me about Jon Arryn
robert	One minute he was fine, and then Burned right through him, whatever it was I loved that man
ned	We both did
robert	He never had to teach you much, but me You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls He showed me what was what
ned	Aye
robert	Don’t look at me like that Not his fault I didn’t listen I need you, Ned Down at Kings Landing Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king
ned	I’m not worthy of the honor
robert	I’m not trying to honor you I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave Damn it, Ned, stand up You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing We were meant to rule together If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood Well, it’s not too late I have a son, you have a daughter We’ll join our Houses
tyrion	Mmh It is true what they say about the Northern girls
ros	Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?
tyrion	I did hear something about that
ros	And the queen And her twin brother They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms
tyrion	And the other brother?
ros	The queen has two brothers?
tyrion	There’s the pretty one And there’s the clever one
ros	I hear they call him the Imp
tyrion	I hear he hates that nickname
ros	Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions
tyrion	Clever girl
ros	We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion
tyrion	Have you?
tyrion	The gods gave me one blessing
jaime	Don’t get up
ros	M’lord
tyrion	Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
jaime	You’ve much to teach me, no doubt But our sister craves your attention
tyrion	She has odd cravings, our sister
jaime	A family trait Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown Don’t leave me alone with these people
tyrion	I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early And this is the first of many courses
jaime	I thought you might say that But since we’re short on time, Come on, girls See you at sundown
tyrion	Close the door!Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyanna’s tomb
robert	Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her
ned	She was my sister This is where she belongs
robert	She belonged with me
robert	In my dreams, I kill him every night
ned	It’s done, Your Grace The Targaryens are gone
robert	Not all of them
viserys	Daenerys
viserys	Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio Touch it Come on Feel the fabric Mmmm Isn’t he a gracious host?
daenerys	We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything
viserys	Illyrio is no fool He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne You still slouch Let me see You have a woman’s body now I need you to be perfect today Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?
daenerys	No
viserys	When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today
maid	It’s too hot, my lady
viserys	Where is he?
illyrio	The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality
illyrio	May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen
viserys	Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame Khal Drogo has never been defeated He’s a savage, of course, but he’s one of the finest killers alive And you will be his queen
illyrio	Come forward, my dear
viserys	Where’s he going?
illyrio	The ceremony is over
viserys	But he didn’t say anything Did he like her?
illyrio	Trust me, Your Grace If he didn’t like her, we’d know
illyrio	It won’t be long now Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne The people drink secret toasts to your health They cry out for their true king
viserys	When will they be married?
illyrio	Soon The Dothraki never stay still for long
viserys	Is it true they lie with their horses?
illyrio	I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo
viserys	Do you take me for a fool?
illyrio	I take you for a king Kings lack the caution of common men My apologies if I’ve given offense
viserys	I know how to play a man like Drogo I give him a queen and he gives me an army DAENERYS I don’t want to be his queen I want to go home
viserys	So do I I want us both to go home But they took it from us So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
daenerys	I don’t know
viserys	We go home with an army With Khal Drogo’s army I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took
sansa	Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
catelyn	Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived
sansa	He’s so handsome
sansa	When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
catelyn	Hush now Your father hasn’t even said yes
sansa	Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms
catelyn	He’d have to leave home He’d have to leave me And so would you
sansa	You left your home to come here And I’d be queen someday Please make father say yes
catelyn	Sansa
sansa	Please, please It’s the only thing I ever wanted
benjen	Is he dead yet?
jon	Uncle Benjen
benjen	You got bigger I rode all day Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters Why aren’t you at the feast?
jon	Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst
benjen	Well, you’re always welcome on the wall No bastard was ever refused a seat there
jon	So take me with you when you go back
benjen	Jon
jon	Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will
benjen	The Wall isn’t going anywhere
jon	I’m ready to swear your oath
benjen	You don’t understand what you’d be giving up We have no families None of us will ever father sons
jon	I don’t care about that
benjen	You might, if you knew what it meant I’d better get inside Rescue your father from his guests We’ll talk later
tyrion	Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch
jon	What’re you doing back there?
tyrion	Preparing for a night with your family I’ve always wanted to see the Wall
jon	You’re Tyrion Lannister The queen’s brother?
tyrion	My greatest accomplishment You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?
tyrion	Did I offend you? Sorry You are the bastard, though
jon	Lord Eddard Stark is my father
tyrion	And Lady Stark is not your mother Making you a bastard Let me give you some advice, bastard Never forget what you are The rest of the world will not Wear it like armor Then it can never be used to hurt you
jon	What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
tyrion	All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes
benjen	You at a feast It’s like a bear in a trap
ned	The boy I beheaded Did you know him?
benjen	Of course I did Just a lad But he was tough, Ned A true Ranger
ned	He was talking madness Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends
benjen	The two he was with are still missing
ned	A wildling ambush
benjen	Maybe Direwolves south of the wall Talk of the Walkers My brother might be the next Hand to the king Winter is coming
ned	Winter is coming
robb	Uncle Benjen
benjen	Robb boy How are ye?
robb	I’m good CATELYN Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
cersei	Yes Lovely country
catelyn	I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time
cersei	Hello, little dove But you are a beauty How old are you?
sansa	Thirteen, Your Grace
cersei	You’re tall Still growing?
sansa	I think so, Your Grace
cersei	And have you bled yet?
sansa	No, Your Grace
cersei	And your dress Did you make it?
cersei	Such talent You must make something for me
cersei	I hear we might share a grandchild someday
catelyn	I hear the same
cersei	Your daughter will do well in the capital Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever
ned	Your pardon
jaime	I hear we might be neighbors soon I hope it’s true
ned	Yes, the king has honored me with his offer
jaime	I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept It would be good to have you in the field The competition has become a bit stale
ned	I don’t fight in tournaments
jaime	No? Getting a little old for it?
ned	I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do
jaime	Well said
sansa	Arya
robb	Time for bed
ned	I’m a Northman I belong here with you, not down south in that rat’s nest they call a capital
catelyn	I won’t let him take you
ned	The king takes what he wants That’s why he’s king
catelyn	I’ll say, Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere He belongs to me now
ned	How did he get so fat?
catelyn	He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink
a voice	It’s Maester Luwin, my lord
ned	Send him in
luwin	Pardon, my lord, my lady A rider in the night from your sister
ned	Stay
catelyn	This was sent from the Eyrie What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding
ned	What news?
catelyn	She’s fled the capital She says Jon Arryn was murdered By the Lannisters She says the king is in danger
ned	She’s fresh widowed, Cat She doesn’t know what she’s saying
catelyn	Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?
luwin	If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
catelyn	They murdered the last Hand Now you want Ned to take the job
luwin	The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help He’s the only one he trusts You swore the king an oath, my lord
catelyn	He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars He owes him nothing Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand
luwin	A different time Different king
viserys	When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion
illyrio	If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it
viserys	When?
illyrio	When their omens favor war
viserys	I piss on Dothraki omens I waited 17 years to get my throne back
illyrio	A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair
jorah	A small gift for the new Khaleesi Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms
daenerys	Thank you, ser Are you from my country?
jorah	Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island I served your father for many years Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king
illyrio	Dragons’ eggs, Daenerys From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful
daenerys	Thank you, Magister
daenerys	She’s beautiful Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say thank you’ in Dothraki
jorah	There is no word for thank you’ in Dothraki
viserys	Make him happy
khal drogo	No
daenerys	Do you know the Common Tongue?
khal drogo	No
daenerys	Is no’ the only word that you know?
khal drogo	No
sandor	Rough night, Imp?
tyrion	If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle
sandor	I didn’t pick you for a hunter
tyrion	The greatest in the land My spear never misses
sandor	It’s not hunting if you pay for it
robert	Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
ned	No, but I’m still better than you
robert	I know what I’m putting you through Thank you for saying yes I only ask you because I need you You’re a loyal friend You hear me? A loyal friend The last one I’ve got
ned	I hope I’ll serve you well
robert	You will And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar
bran	Come on, you
cersei	Stop STOP
jaime	Are you completely mad?
cersei	He saw us
jaime	It’s all right It’s all right
cersei	He saw us
jaime	I heard you the first time Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?
bran	Ten
jaime	Ten
jaime	The things I do for love BLACKOUT
jorah	You need to drink, child And eat
daenerys	Isnt there anything else?
jorah	The Dothraki have two things in abundance grass and horses People cant live on grass In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night It murders all other grass The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything Thats the way the world will end Itll get easier
doreah	Khaleesi
irri	Your hands
jorah	Were still not far from Pentos, your Grace Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality Youd be more comfortable there
viserys	I have no interest in hospitality or comfort Ill stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown
jorah	As you wish, your Grace
viserys	Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
jorah	Selling to one Some poachers I caught on my land
viserys	Under my reign, you wont be punished for such nonsense You can rest assured of that -
joffrey	Better-looking bitches than youre used to, Uncle My mothers been looking for you We ride for Kings Landing today
tyrion	Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies
joffrey	What good will my sympathies do them?
tyrion	None But it is expected of you Your absence has already been noted
joffrey	The boy means nothing to me And I cant stand the wailing of women
tyrion	One word and Ill hit you again
joffrey	Im telling mother
tyrion	Go! Tell her But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them Do you understand?
joffrey	You cant.
tyrion	Do you understand?
sandor clegane	The Prince will remember that, little lord
tyrion	I hope so If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him Time for breakfast.
tyrion	Bread And two of those little fish And a mug of dark beer to wash it down And bacon, burnt black
jaime	Little brother
tyrion	Beloved siblings
myrcella	Is Bran going to die?
tyrion	Apparently not
cersei	What do you mean?
tyrion	The Maester says the boy may live
cersei	Its no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain
tyrion	Only the gods know for certain All the rest of us can do is pray The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you
cersei	I still cant believe youre going Its ridiculous even for you
tyrion	Wheres your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Nights Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers
jaime	Tell me youre not thinking of taking the black
tyrion	And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world
cersei	The children dont need to hear your filth Come
jaime	Even if the boy lives, hell be a cripple, a grotesque Give me a good clean death any day
tyrion	Speaking for the grotesques, Id have to disagree Death is so final, whereas life Life is full of possibilities I hope the boy does wake Id be very interested to hear what he has to say
jaime	My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side youre on
tyrion	My dear brother, you wound me You know how much I love my family -
cersei	Please
catelyn	I would have dressed, your Grace
cersei	This is your home Im your guest Handsome one, isnt he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty He was a fighter too Tried to beat the fever that took him Forgive me Its the last thing you need to hear right now
catelyn	I never knew
cersei	It was years ago Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care The boy looked just like him Such a little thing A bird without feathers They came to take his body away and Robert held me I screamed and I battled, but he held me That little bundle They took him away and I never saw him again Never have visited the crypt, never I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you
catelyn	I am grateful
cersei	Perhaps this time shell listen -
jaime	A sword for the wall?
jon	I already have one
jaime	Good man Have you swung it yet?
jon	Of course I have
jaime	At someone, I mean Its a strange thing, the first time you cut a man You realize were nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot Were grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us
jon	Weve guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years
jaime	Is it we already? Have you taken your vows then?
jon	Soon enough
jaime	Give my regards to the Nights Watch Im sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force And if not, Its only for life -
arya	Thank you, Nymeria Septa Mordane says I have to do it again My things werent properly folded , she says Who cares how theyre folded?! Theyre going to get all messed up anyway

jon	So are you I had the blacksmith make it for you special It wont hack a mans head off, but it can poke him full of holes if youre quick enough
arya	I can be quick
jon	Youll have to work at it every day How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
arya	I think so
jon	First lesson Stick them with the pointy end
arya	I know which end to use
jon	Im going to miss you Careful All the best swords have names, you know
arya	Sansa can keep her sewing needles Ive got a needle of my own -
jon	I came to say goodbye to Bran
catelyn	Youve said it
jon	I wish I could be here when you wake up Im going north with Uncle Benjen Im taking the black I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but youll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when youre better Ill know my way around by then Ill be a sworn brother of the Nights Watch We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if youre not afraid
catelyn	I want you to leave
catelyn	17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon You came back a year later with another womans son And now youre leaving again
ned	I have no choice

ned	You should have asked me 20 years ago
robert	There were wars to fight, women to marry We never had the chance to be young
ned	I recall a few chances
robert	There was that one Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in

robert	Thats it She must have been a rare wench to make Lord forget his honor You never told me what she looked like
ned	Nor will I
robert	We were at war None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again Youre too hard on yourself You always have been I swear if I werent your King, youd have hit me already
ned	The worst thing about your coronation Ill never get to hit you again
robert	Trust me, thats not the worst thing There was a rider in the night
ned	Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
robert	A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it
ned	Shes little more than a child
robert	Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding
ned	Tell me were not speaking of this
robert	Oh, its unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family That was unspeakable What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister the woman I loved Ill kill every Targaryen I get my hands on
ned	But you cant get your hands on this one, can you?
robert	This Khal Drogo, its said he has 100,000 men in his horde
ned	Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea They have no ships, Robert
robert	There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him
ned	He will not cross And if by chance he does, well throw him back into the sea
robert	Theres a war coming, Ned I dont know when, I dont know who well be fighting, but its coming -
benjen	Sit Youll be fed Untie them
tyrion	Rapers They were given a choice no doubt Castration or the Wall Most choose the knife Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch You discard your old family and get a whole new one
jon	Why do you read so much?
tyrion	Look at me and tell me what you see
jon	Is this a trick?
tyrion	What you see is a dwarf If Id been born a peasant they mightve left me out in the woods to die Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock Things are expected of me My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years
jon	Until your brother killed that King
tyrion	Yes, until my brother killed him Life is full of these little ironies My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldnt you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone Thats why I read so much And you? Whats your story, bastard?
jon	Ask me nicely and maybe Ill tell you, dwarf
tyrion	A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Nights Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms
jon	The Nights Watch protects the realm from.
tyrion	Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about Youre a smart boy You dont believe that nonsense Everythings better with some wine in the belly -
maester luwin	Its time we reviewed the accounts, my lady Youll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us
catelyn	Talk to Poole about it
maester luwin	Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention.
catelyn	I dont care about appointments
robb	Ill make the appointments Well talk about it first thing in the morning
maester luwin	Very good, my Lord My Lady
robb	When was the last time you left this room?
catelyn	I have to take care of him
robb	Hes not going to die, mother Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed
catelyn	What if hes wrong? Bran needs me
robb	Rickon needs you Hes six He doesnt know whats happening He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying.
catelyn	Close the windows! I cant stand it! Please make them stop
robb	Fire You stay here Ill come back
assassin	Youre not supposed to be here No one is supposed to be here Its a mercy Hes dead already
catelyn	No! -
daenerys	Have you ever seen a dragon?
irri	Dragon gone, Khaleesi
daenerys	Everywhere? Even in the east?
irri	No dragon Brave men kill them It is known
jhiqui	It is known
doreah	A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon
daenerys	The moon?
doreah	He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the suns fire
irri	Moon is no egg Moon is goddess wife of sun It is known
jhiqui	It is known
daenerys	Leave me with her Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
doreah	Men like to talk when theyre happy Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy
daenerys	How old were you?
doreah	I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house
daenerys	Nine?
doreah	I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi First you must learn
daenerys	Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
doreah	Yes
daenerys	Will it take three years?
doreah	No -
benjen	Welcome -
catelyn	What I am about to tell you must remain between us I dont think Bran fell from that tower I think he was thrown
maester luwin	The boy was always sure-footed before
catelyn	Someone tried to kill him twice Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasnt meant to see
theon	Saw what, my lady?
catelyn	I dont know But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown
rodrick cassel	Did you notice the dagger the killer used? Its too fine a weapon for such a man The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone Someone gave it to him
robb	They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If its war they want.
theon	If it comes to that, you know Ill stand behind you
maester luwin	What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war We dont know the truth yet Lord Stark must be told of this
catelyn	I dont trust a raven to carry these words
robb	Ill ride to Kings Landing
catelyn	No There must always be a Stark in Winterfell I will go myself
robb	Mother, you cant
catelyn	I must
rodrick cassel	Ill send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you
catelyn	Too large a party attracts unwanted attention I dont want the Lannisters to know Im coming
rodrick cassel	Let me accompany you at least ingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone
robb	What about Bran?
catelyn	I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month Brans life is in their hands now -
doreah	No, Khaleesi You must look in his eyes always Love comes in at the eyes It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes
daenerys	Finish a man?
doreah	Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia Magisters sold their palaces Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all
daenerys	Well, she sounds like an interesting woman I dont think that Drogo will like it with me on top
doreah	You will make him like it, Khaleesi Men want what theyve never had And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then dont make love like a slave Very good, Khaleesi Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you
daenerys	I dont think that this is the Dothraki way
doreah	If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
daenerys	No No Tonight I would look upon your face -
sansa	Pardon me, Ser
sandor clegane	Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too Look at that face
sansa	Im sorry if I offended you, Ser Why wont he speak to me?
sandor clegane	He hasnt been very talkative these last 20 years Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers
joffrey	He speaks damn well with his sword though Ser Ilyn Payne, the Kings justice The royal executioner What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog Youre scaring my lady I dont like to see you upset The sun is finally shining Come walk with me
sansa	Stay, Lady I probably shouldnt have any more Father only lets us have one cup at feasts
joffrey	My princess can drink as much as she wants Dont worry Youre safe with me

sansa	He the butchers boy
arya	Hes my friend
joffrey	A butchers boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butchers boy Lets see how good you are
mycah	She asked me to, my Lord She asked me to
joffrey	Im your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword
mycah	Its not a sword, my prince Its only a stick
joffrey	And youre not a Knight Only a butchers boy That was my ladys sister you were hitting, do you know that?
arya	Stop it
sansa	Arya, stay out of this
joffrey	I wont hurt him Much Filthy little bitch
sansa	No no, stop it, stop it, both of you Youre spoiling it Youre spoiling everything
joffrey	Ill gut you, you little cunt
sansa	Arya
arya	Nymeria
joffrey	Please dont
sansa	Arya, leave him alone My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you Stay here, Ill go back to the inn and bring help

soldier	Its a direwolf
soldier	Ill check down here
soldier	I think I heard a noise
arya	Go
jory cassel	My lord! My lord! They found her Shes unharmed
ned	Where is she?
jory cassel	Shes been taken directly before the King
ned	Who took her?
jory cassel	The Lannisters found her
ned	Right, get back
jory cassel	The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him
ned	Back! Back to the inn All back! -
arya	Im sorry
ned	Are you hurt?
arya	No
ned	Its all right What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
cersei	How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
robert	Quiet, woman Sorry, Ned I never meant to frighten the girl But we need to get this business done quickly
cersei	Your girl and that butchers boy attacked my son That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off
arya	Thats not true! She just Bit him a little He was hurting Mycah
cersei	Joffrey told us what happened You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him
arya	Thats not what happened
joffrey	Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river
arya	Liar
joffrey	Shut up
robert	Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Wheres your other daughter, Ned?
ned	In bed asleep
cersei	Shes not Sansa, come here, darling
robert	Now, child Tell me what happened Tell it all and tell it true Its a great crime to lie to a King
sansa	I dont know I dont remember Everything happened so fast I didnt see
arya	Liar! Liar liar liar
sansa	Arya
ned	Stop it! Thats enough of that
arya	Liar liar liar
ned	Stop! Arya
cersei	Shes as wild as that animal of hers I want her punished
robert	What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight Its over
cersei	Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life
robert	You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined Ill do the same with my son
ned	Gladly, your Grace
cersei	And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
robert	Id forgot the damned wolf
soldier	We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace
robert	So be it
cersei	We have another wolf
robert	As you will
ned	You cant mean it
robert	A direwolfs no pet Get her a dog Shell be happier for it
sansa	He doesnt mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didnt bite anyone! Shes good
arya	Lady wasnt there! You leave her alone
sansa	Stop them Dont let them do it Please! It wasnt Lady
ned	s this your command your Grace?
cersei	Where is the beast?
soldier	Chained up outside, your Grace
cersei	Ser Ilyn, do me the honor
ned	No Jory Take the girls to their rooms If it must be done, then Ill do it myself
cersei	Is this some trick?
ned	The wolf is of the north She deserves better than a butcher
ned	The butchers boy You rode him down?
landing guard	Welcome, Lord Stark Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council The honor of your presence is requested
ned	Get the girls settled in Ill be back in time for supper And, Jory, you go with them
jory cassel	Yes, my Lord.King
landing guard	If youd like to change into something more appropriate
jaime	Thank the gods youre here, Stark About time we had some stern northern leadership
ned	Glad to see youre protecting the throne
jaime	Sturdy old thing How many kings asses have polished it, I wonder? Whats the line? ing shits and the Hand wipes
ned	Very handsome armor Not a scratch on it
jaime	I know People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss
ned	Youve chosen your opponents wisely then
jaime	I have a knack for it It must be strange for you coming into this room I was standing right here when it happened He was very brave, your brother Your father too They didnt deserve to die like that Nobody deserves to die like that
ned	But you just stood there and watched
jaime	500 men just stood there and watched All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing And later When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned It felt like justice
ned	Is that what you tell yourself at night? Youre a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryens back?
jaime	Tell me If Id stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
ned	You served him well, when serving was safe -
varys	Lord Stark
ned	Lord
varys	I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad We are all praying for Prince Joffreys full recovery
ned	A shame you didnt say a prayer for the butchers son Renly! Youre looking well
renly	And you look tired from the road I told them this meeting could wait another day, but.
littlefinger	But we have a Kingdom to look after Ive hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me
ned	She has, Lord Baelish I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well
littlefinger	All too well I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone
ned	Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with
littlefinger	It wasnt the man that I chose, my Lord It was Catelyn Tully A woman worth fighting for, Im sure youll agree
grand maester pycelle	I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark
ned	Grand Maester
grand maester pycelle	How many years has it been? You were a young man
ned	And you served another King
grand maester pycelle	How forgetful of me This belongs to you, now Should we begin?
ned	Without the King?
renly	Winter may be coming, but Im afraid the same cannot be said for my brother
varys	His Grace has many cares He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load
littlefinger	We are the lords of small matters here
renly	My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Starks appointment as Hand of the King
littlefinger	Mmm, how much?
ned	40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer
grand maester pycelle	Can the treasury bear such expense?
littlefinger	Ill have to borrow it The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold Whats another 80,000?
ned	Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
littlefinger	Im telling you the Crown is six million in debt
ned	How could you let this happen?
littlefinger	The Master of Coin finds the money ing and the Hand spend it
ned	I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm
grand maester pycelle	Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesnt always listen
renly	Counting coppers, he calls it
ned	Ill speak to him tomorrow This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford
littlefinger	As you will But still, wed best make our plans
ned	There will be no plans until I speak to Robert Forgive me, my Lords I had a long ride
varys	You are the Kings Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure -
cersei	Please, its nearly healed
joffrey	Its ugly
cersei	A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf Youre a warrior like your father
joffrey	Im not like him I didnt fight off anything It bit me and all I did was scream And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them
cersei	Thats not true You killed the beast You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor Someday youll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it
joffrey	Do I have to marry her?
cersei	Yes Shes very beautiful and young If you dont like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses And if youd rather fuck painted whores, youll fuck painted whores And if youd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be Do something nice for the Stark girl
joffrey	I dont want to
cersei	No, but you will The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road
joffrey	We allow the northerners too much power They consider themselves our equals
cersei	How would you handle them?
joffrey	Id double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army
cersei	A royal army?
joffrey	Why should every lord command his own men? Its primitive, no better than the hill tribes We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers Instead of a mob of peasants whove never held pikes in their lives
cersei	And if the northerners rebel?
joffrey	Id crush them Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North Uncle Kevan, maybe
cersei	And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
joffrey	For me Im their King
cersei	But youve just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers
joffrey	Im not asking
cersei	The North cannot be held not by an outsider Its too big and too wild When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldnt save you and your royal army A good King knows when to save his strength And when to destroy his enemies
joffrey	So you agree The Starks are enemies?
cersei	Everyone who isnt us is an enemy -
septa mordane	Enough of that, young lady Eat your food
arya	Im practicing
sansa	Practicing for what?
arya	The Prince
septa mordane	Arya, stop
arya	Hes a liar and a coward and he killed my friend
sansa	The Hound killed your friend
arya	The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do
sansa	Youre an idiot
arya	Youre a liar And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive
septa mordane	Enough
ned	Whats happening here?
septa mordane	Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady
ned	Go to your room Well speak later Thats for you, love
ned	The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcellas toys Dont you like it?
sansa	I havent played with dolls since I was eight May I be excused?
septa mordane	Youve barely eaten a thing
ned	Its all right Go on
ned	War was easier than daughters
arya	Go away
ned	Arya, open the door May I come in? Whose sword is that?
arya	Mine
ned	Give it to me I know this makers mark This is Mikkens work Where did you get this? This is no toy Little ladies shouldnt play with swords
arya	I wasnt playing And I dont want to be a lady
ned	Come here Now what do you want with this?
arya	Its called Needle
ned	A blade with a name And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
arya	Stick em with the pointy end
ned	Thats the essence of it
arya	I was trying to learn I asked Mycah to practice with me I asked him It was my fault
ned	No, sweet girl You didnt kill the butchers boy
arya	I hate them! I hate all of them The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa
ned	Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen And asked to call the Prince a liar
arya	So was I! He is a liar
ned	Darling, listen to me Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday She cannot betray him She must take his side even when hes wrong
arya	But how you can let her marry someone like that?
ned	Well Look at me Youre a Stark of Winterfell You know our words
arya	Winter is coming
ned	You were born in the long summer Youve never known anything else But now winter is truly coming And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another Sansa is your sister
arya	I dont hate her Not really
ned	I dont want to frighten you, but I wont lie to you either Weve come to a dangerous place We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves All right? Go on Its yours
arya	I can keep it?
ned	Try not to stab your sister with it If youre going to own a sword, youd better know how to use it -
old nan	Dont listen to it Crows are all liars I know a story about a crow
bran	I hate your stories
old nan	I know a story about a boy who hated stories I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall Those were always your favorites
bran	Those werent my favorites My favorites were the scary ones
old nan	Oh, my sweet summer child What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds
robb	What are you telling him now?
old nan	Only what the little Lord wants to hear
robb	Get your supper I want some time with him One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber
bran	Maybe we do
robb	How do you feel? You still dont remember anything? Ive seen you climb a thousand times In the wind, in the rain A thousand times You never fall
bran	I did though Its true, isnt it what Maester Luwin says about my legs? Id rather be dead
robb	Dont ever say that
bran	Id rather be dead -
rodrick cassel	Fewer eyes back here, my Lady But still too many
catelyn	Its nine years since Ive set foot in the capital And no one knew who I was the last time I came either
rodrick cassel	My Lady
guard	Welcome to Kings Landing, Lady Stark Would you mind following us?
catelyn	I would Weve done nothing wrong
guard	Weve been instructed to escort you into the city
catelyn	Instructed? I dont know whos providing your instructions, but.
guard	Follow me, Lady Stark
littlefinger	Cat! Go on Go upstairs
catelyn	You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a
littlefinger	I meant no disrespect to you of all people
catelyn	How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
littlefinger	No one will come looking for you here Isnt that what like you wanted? Im truly sorry about the locale
catelyn	How did you know I was coming to Kings Landing?
littlefinger	A dear friend told me
varys	Lady Stark
catelyn	Lord
varys	To see you again after so many years is a blessing Your poor hands
catelyn	How did you know I was coming?
varys	Knowledge is my trade, my Lady Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere Even in the north They whisper to me the strangest stories Valyrian steel
catelyn	Do you know whose dagger this is?
varys	I must admit I do not
littlefinger	Well well, this is an historic day Something you dont know that I do Theres only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms Its mine
catelyn	Yours?
littlefinger	At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffreys last nameday I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger
catelyn	To whom?
littlefinger	Tyrion Lannister The Imp -
alliser thorne	If that were a real sword, youd be dead Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you Pyp Do you think Ned Starks bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
alliser thorne	Next
alliser thorne	Next
alliser thorne	Lord Snow, it appears youre the least useless person here Go clean yourselves up Theres only so much I can stomach in a day
tyrion	A charming man
jeor	I dont need him to be charming I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Nights Watch
tyrion	And hows that going, Commander Mormont?
jeor	Slowly A raven came for Ned Starks son
tyrion	Good news or bad?
jeor	Both -
grand maester pycelle	Lord Stark I meant to give you this earlier So forgetful these days A raven from Winterfell this morning
littlefinger	Good news? Perhaps youd like to share it with your wife?
ned	My wife is in Winterfell
littlefinger	Is she?
littlefinger	I thought that shed be safest in here One of several such establishments I own
ned	Youre a funny man A very funny man
catelyn	Ned
littlefinger	The Starks Quick tempers, slow minds -
grenn	You broke my nose, bastard
jon	Its an improvement
grenn	If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long itd take you to hit
pyp	I wonder if theyd find you before the wolves did
grenn	Whatre you looking at, halfman?
tyrion	Im looking at you Youve got an interesting face Very distinctive faces All of you
rast	What do you care about our faces?
tyrion	Its just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in Kings Landing Perhaps Ill write my sister, the Queen, about it
grenn	Well talk later, Lord Snow
jon	Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me No one but you My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same
tyrion	Grenns father left him too Outside a farmhouse when he was three Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese His little sister hadnt eaten in three days He was given a choice his right hand or the Wall Ive been asking the Lord Commander about them Fascinating stories
jon	They hate me because Im better than they are
tyrion	Its a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik I dont imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here Your brother Bran Hes woken up -
littlefinger	The mere suggestion that the Queens brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason
catelyn	We have proof We have the blade
littlefinger	Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boys wolf
catelyn	Petyr has promised to help us find the truth Hes like a little brother to me He would never betray my trust
littlefinger	Ill try to keep you alive, for her sake A fools task, admittedly, but Ive never been able to refuse your wife anything
catelyn	I wont forget this Youre a true friend
littlefinger	Dont tell anyone I have a reputation to maintain -
cersei	How could you be so stupid?
jaime	Calm down
cersei	Hes a child 10 years old What were you thinking?
jaime	I was thinking of us Youre a bit late to start complaining about it now What has the boy told them?
cersei	Nothing Hes said nothing He remembers nothing
jaime	Then what are you raving about?
cersei	What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw.
jaime	Well say he was lying Well say he was dreaming Well say whatever we like I think we can outfox a 10-year-old
cersei	And my husband?
jaime	Ill go to war with him if I have to They can write a ballad about us The War for Cerseis Cunt
cersei	Let me go
jaime	Never
cersei	Let me go
jaime	The boy wont talk And if he does, Ill kill him Him, Ned Stark, the King the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world -
catelyn	I wish I could see the girls
ned	Its too dangerous
catelyn	Just for a moment
ned	Until we know who our enemies are.
catelyn	I know they did it, Ned The Lannisters In my bones, I know it
ned	Littlefingers right I cant do anything without proof
cersei	And if you find the proof?
ned	Then I bring it to Robert And hope hes still the man I once knew You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing
catelyn	My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday
ned	He still loves you
catelyn	Does he?
ned	Off with you -
robert	Its been a long time But I still remember every face You remember your first?
barristan selmy	Of course, your Grace
robert	Who was it?
barristan selmy	A Tyroshi Never learned the name
robert	Howd you do it?
barristan selmy	Lance through the heart
robert	Quick one Lucky for you Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword I knocked him down with the hammer Gods, I was strong then Caved in his breastplate Probably shattered every rib he had Stood over him, hammer in the air Right before I brought it down he shouted, Wait! Wait! They never tell you how they all shit themselves They dont put that part in the songs Stupid boy Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and hed be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl Wine! Lancel Gods, what a stupid name Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
lancel	Its empty, your Grace
robert	What do you mean its empty?
lancel	Theres no more wine
robert	Is that what empty means?! So get more Tell your cousin to get in here Kingslayer! Get in here Surrounded by Lannisters Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry , son of the mighty Tywin Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks So come on Were telling war stories Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
jaime	One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood
barristan selmy	I was there that day You were only a squire, 16 years old
jaime	You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte Best move I ever saw
barristan selmy	A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina
robert	Your outlaw Any last words?
jaime	I cut his head off, so no
robert	What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
jaime	He said the same thing hed been saying for hours Burn them all If thats all, your Grace -
	Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
jorah	The Dothraki dont believe in money Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts
daenerys	From whom?
jorah	If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices pay tribute or fight An easy choice for most Of course, sometimes its not enough Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves hes given He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly Sometimes a Khal decides his riders havent had a good fight in months and need the practice
daenerys	Tell them all to stop
jorah	You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
daenerys	Until I command them otherwise
jorah	Youre learning to talk like a Queen
daenerys	Not a Queen A Khaleesi
viserys	You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms I dont take orders from savages or their sluts Do you hear me?
irri	Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi
daenerys	No
irri	Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect
daenerys	Please please, dont hurt him Tell him I dont want my brother harmed
viserys	Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King
jorah	Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
rakharo	You walk -
benjen	I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time Im leaving this morning
jon	Youre leaving?
benjen	Im the First Ranger My job is out there There have been disturbing reports
jon	What kind of reports?
benjen	The kind I dont want to believe
jon	m ready I wont let you down
benjen	Youre not going Youre no ranger, Jon
jon	But Im better than every.
benjen	Better than no one! Here A man gets what he earns, when he earns it Well speak when I return -
yoren	A bears balls
tyrion	Youre joking?
yoren	And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat When youre a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves
tyrion	And how do a bears balls taste?
yoren	A bit chewy And what about you, my Lord? Whats the strangest thing youve eaten?
tyrion	Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
yoren	But its not all of ems done bad things Some of ems just poor lads looking for steady feed Some of ems high-born lads looking for glory
tyrion	They have a better chance finding feed than glory
benjen	The Nights Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
tyrion	You dont have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny
benjen	I hope weve provided you with some good stories to tell when youre back in Kings Landing But something to think about while youre drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels Half the boys youve seen training will die north of the Wall Might be a wildings axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold They die in pain And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort
tyrion	Do you think Im plump? Listen, Benjen May I call you Benjen?
benjen	Call me what you like
tyrion	Im not sure what Ive done to offend you I have great admiration for the Nights Watch Ive great admiration for you as First Ranger
benjen	You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word but really counts
tyrion	But I dont believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it
benjen	Youre right The wildlings are no different from us A little rougher maybe But theyre made of meat and bone I know how to track them and I know how to kill them Its not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights Youve never been north of the Wall, so dont tell me whats out there
yoren	Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm
benjen	Enjoy the capital, brother
yoren	I always do
tyrion	I think hes starting to like me Going below ?
yoren	Into the tunnel and out the other side Hell be north of the Wall for a month or two
tyrion	So youre heading down to Kings Landing too
yoren	Day after tomorrow I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons
tyrion	Lets share the road I could use some decent company
yoren	I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord
tyrion	Not this time Well be staying at the finest castles and inns No one turns away a Lannister -
irri	Yes, Khaleesi
daenerys	What are you doing?
irri	When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion
jorah	For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle Its a good weapon for a Dothrakan But a man in full plate the arakh wont get through the steel Thats where the broadsword has the advantage Designed for piercing plate
rakharo	Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses
jorah	Armor
rakharo	Armor Armor make a man Vroz?
jorah	Slow
rakharo	Slow
jorah	Its true, but it also keeps a man alive
rakharo	My father taught me how to fight He taught me that speed defeats size
jorah	I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior
rakharo	He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
jorah	He still is A man of great honor And I betrayed him
irri	haleesi wants to eat something different tonight Kill some rabbits
rakharo	There are no rabbits
irri	Find some ducks, she likes ducks
rakharo	Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
irri	Dog then I have seen many dogs
jorah	I dont think she wants to eat dog
irri	haleesi have baby inside her It is true She does not bleed for two moons Her belly start to swell
rakharo	A blessing from the Great Stallion
irri	She does not want to eat horse
jorah	Ill have the boys butcher a goat for supper I need to ride to Qohor
rhakaro	We ride for Vaes Dothrak
jorah	Dont worry Ill catch you The hordes easy to find -
jon	Dont stand so still Its harder to hit a moving target Except for you You move too much I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me
maester aemon	How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
tyrion	Eight no, nine
maester aemon	All of them brief?
tyrion	They say the winter of my birth was three years long,
maester aemon	This summer has lasted nine But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter The Starks are always right eventually winter is coming This one will be long and dark things will come with it
jeor	Weve been capturing wildlings, more every month Theyre fleeing south The ones who flee say theyve seen the White Walkers
tyrion	Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids
jeor	One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off
maester aemon	The Nights Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men There are less than a thousand of us now We cant man the other castles on the Wall We cant properly patrol the wilderness Weve barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed
jeor	Your sister sits by the side of the King Tell her we need help
maester aemon	When winter does come, gods help us all if were not ready -
daenerys	It’s a boy
khal drogo	How do you know?
daenerys	I know -
jon	Im sorry to see you leave, Lannister
tyrion	Its either me or this cold And it doesnt appear to be going anywhere
jon	Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
tyrion	I expect I will Gods know there arent many feather beds between here and Kings Landing
jon	If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him Tell him Id visit if I could
tyrion	Of course
jon	Hell never walk again
tyrion	If youre going to be a cripple, its better to be a rich cripple Take care, Snow
jon	Farewell, My Lord -
syrio forel	You are late, boy Tomorrow you will be here at midday
arya	Who are you?
syrio forel	Your dancing master
syrio forel	Tomorrow you will catch it Now pick it up That is not the way, boy This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it
arya	Its too heavy
syrio forel	It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong Just so One hand is all that is needed Now you are standing all wrong Turn your body side-face So You are skinny That is good The target is smaller Now the grip Let me see The grip must be delicate
arya	What if I drop it?
syrio forel	The steel must be part of your arm Can you drop part of your arm? No Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos He knows these things You must listen to me, boy
arya	Im a girl
syrio forel	Boy, girl You are a sword, that is all That is the grip You are not holding a battle-axe You are holding.
arya	A needle
syrio forel	Ahhh Just so Now we will begin the dance Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning The knights dance, hacking and hammering This is the Bravos dance The water dance It is swift and sudden All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die Now you will try to strike me
old nan	The little Lords been dreaming again
theon	We have visitors
bran	I dont want to see anyone
theon	Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, Id go mad Anyway, you dont have a choice Robbs waiting
bran	I dont want to go
theon	Neither do I But Robbs Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say Hodor! Help Bran down the hall
tyrion	I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit
robb	Any man of the Nights Watch is welcome at Winterfell
tyrion	Any man of the Nights Watch, but not I, eh, boy?
robb	Im not your boy, Lannister Im Lord of Winterfell while my father is away
tyrion	Then you might learn a lords courtesy
tyrion	So its true Hello Bran Do you remember anything about what happened?
maester luwin	He has no memory of that day
tyrion	Curious
robb	Why are you here?
tyrion	Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt
bran	Kneel, Hodor
tyrion	Do you like to ride, Bran?
bran	Yes Well, I mean I did like to
maester luwin	The boy has lost the use of his legs
tyrion	What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride
bran	Im not a cripple
tyrion	Then Im not a dwarf My father will rejoice to hear it I have a gift for you Give that to your saddler Hell provide the rest You must shape the horse to the rider Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boys voice
bran	Will I really be able to ride?
tyrion	You will On horseback you will be as tall as any of them
robb	Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
tyrion	I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things
robb	Youve done my brother a kindness The hospitality of Winterfell is yours
tyrion	Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark Theres a brothel outside your walls There Ill find a bed and both of us can sleep easier
theon	Couldnt resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros
tyrion	Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you Your master doesnt seem to like Lannisters
theon	Hes not my master
tyrion	No, of course not What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didnt she receive me?
theon	She wasnt feeling well
tyrion	Shes not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?
theon	My ladys whereabouts.
tyrion	My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my fathers fleet burn in Lannisport I believe your uncles were responsible?
theon	Must have been a pretty sight
tyrion	Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive Yes, a great victory for your people Shame how it all turned out
theon	We were outnumbered 10 to one
tyrion	A stupid rebellion then I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle Now here you are, your enemys squire
theon	Careful, Imp
tyrion	Ive offended you Forgive me, its been a rough morning Anyway, dont despair Im a constant disappointment to my own father and Ive learned to live with it Your next tumble with Ros is on me Ill try not to wear her out -

jorah	Vaes Dothrak The city of the horselords
viserys	A pile of mud Mud and shit and twigs best these savages can do
daenerys	These are my people now You shouldnt call them savages
viserys	Ill call them what I like, because theyre my people This is my army Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army
daenerys	If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
jorah	The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea They fear any water their horses cant drink
daenerys	But if they did?
jorah	King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different
daenerys	And you know these men?
jorah	I fought beside them once, long ago Now Ned Stark wants my head He drove me from my land
daenerys	You sold slaves
jorah	Aye
daenerys	Why?
jorah	I had no money and an expensive wife
daenerys	And where is she now?
jorah	In another place, with another man -
doreah	Your Grace?
viserys	Yes, my dear?
doreah	They call you the last dragon.
viserys	They do
doreah	You have dragons blood in your veins?
viserys	Its entirely possible
doreah	What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all
viserys	The brave men didnt kill dragons The brave men rode them Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them melted together like so many candles
doreah	I have always wanted to see a dragon There is nothing in the world that I would rather see
viserys	Really? Why dragons?
doreah	They can fly And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and theyre somewhere else Far away And they can kill Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing melted like so many candles Seeing a dragon would make me very happy
viserys	Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy
doreah	I was not locked in I have seen things
viserys	What have you seen?
doreah	Ive seen A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass Ive seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes And Ive seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk So Have you seen one?
viserys	A pirate ship?
doreah	A dragon
viserys	No, the last one died many years before I was born Ill tell you what I have seen their skulls They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and Id recite their names for him When I got them all right, hed give me a sweet The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong Skulls no bigger than dog skulls But as you got closer to the Iron Throne They got bigger and bigger and bigger There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar And Balerion the Dread whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one
doreah	What happened to the skulls?
viserys	I dont know The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect Scattered to the wind
doreah	Thats very sad
viserys	Yes, it is What did I buy you for? To make me sad?
doreah	No, your Grace To teach your sister
viserys	To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot Go on then Get on with it -
septa mordane	Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince.
sansa	What if I have a girl?
septa mordane	Gods be good, youll have boys and girls and plenty of them
sansa	What if I only have girls?
septa mordane	I wouldnt worry about that
sansa	Jeyne Pooles mother had five children, all of them girls
septa mordane	Yes, but its highly unlikely
sansa	But what if?
septa mordane	If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffreys little brother
sansa	And everyone would hate me
septa mordane	Nobody could ever hate you
sansa	Joffrey does
septa mordane	Nonsense Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? Ive told you a hundred times A direwolf is not.
sansa	Please shut up about it
septa mordane	Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
sansa	Aegon the Conqueror
septa mordane	And who built the Red Keep?
sansa	Maegor the Cruel
septa mordane	And how many years did it take to build.
sansa	My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, werent they?
septa mordane	They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes
sansa	The Mad King
septa mordane	Commonly known as the Mad King
sansa	Why were they killed?
septa mordane	You should speak to your father about these matters
sansa	I dont want to speak to my father, ever
septa mordane	You will find it in your heart to forgive your father
sansa	No, I wont -
janos slynt	Its the Hands tournament thats causing all this trouble, my Lords
ned	ings tournament I assure you the Hand wants no part of it
janos slynt	Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters
varys	Dreadful
renly	If you cant keep the Kings peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can
janos slynt	I need more men
ned	Youll get 50 Lord Baelish will see it paid for
littlefinger	I will?
ned	You found money for a champions purse, you can find money to keep the peace Ill also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left
janos slynt	Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser They will be put to good use
ned	The sooner this is over, the better
varys	The realm prospers from such events, my Lord They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes
littlefinger	And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged
ned	Im sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket Now If theres nothing else, my Lords?
grand maester pycelle	This heat On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows Until tomorrow my Lord
ned	Ive been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn
grand maester pycelle	Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him His sickness struck him very hard and very fast I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed Lord Jon often came to me for counsel
ned	Why?
grand maester pycelle	I have been Grand Maester for many years Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since.
ned	What did Jon want the night before he died?
grand maester pycelle	He came inquiring after a book
ned	A book? What book?
grand maester pycelle	I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord A ponderous tome
ned	Id like to read it
grand maester pycelle	The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children
ned	Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegons landing, at the last hearth Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt
grand maester pycelle	As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read
ned	Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
grand maester pycelle	He did not, my Lord And I did not presume to ask
ned	Jons death.
grand maester pycelle	Such a tragedy
ned	Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
grand maester pycelle	Nothing of import, my Lord There was one phrase he kept repeating The seed is strong, I think it was
ned	The seed is strong ? What does that mean?
grand maester pycelle	The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark For all the weight theyre given, last words are usually as significant as first words
ned	And youre quite certain he died of a natural illness?
grand maester pycelle	What else could it be?
ned	Poison
grand maester pycelle	A disturbing thought I dont think it likely The Hand was loved by all What sort of man would dare.
ned	Ive heard it said that poison is a womans weapon
grand maester pycelle	Yes Women, cravens and eunuchs Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?
ned	Everybody knows that
grand maester pycelle	Yes, yes, of course How that sort of person found himself on the Kings Council, I will never know
ned	Ive taken enough of your time
grand maester pycelle	No trouble at all, my Lord Its a great honor.
ned	Thank you Ill find my own way out -
arya	Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours
ned	Its a hard fall down these steps
arya	Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better Tomorrow Im going to be chasing cats
ned	Cats? Syrio says
arya	He says every swordsman should study cats Theyre quiet as shadows and as light as feathers You have to be quick to catch them
ned	Hes right about that
arya	Now that Brans awake will he come live with us?
ned	He needs to get his strength back first
arya	He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard He cant be one now, can he?
ned	No But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the Kings Council Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder
arya	Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
ned	You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords
arya	No Thats not me -
sam	Hello Ser Alliser said Im to be your new watch partner I should warn you, I dont see all that well
jon	Come stand by the fire Its warmer
sam	No, thats all right Im fine
jon	Youre not Youre freezing
sam	I dont like high places
jon	You cant fight You cant see Youre afraid of heights and almost everything else probably What are you doing here, Sam?
sam	On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me Youre almost a man now, he said, but youre not worthy of my land and title Tomorrow, youre going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north If you do not, he said, then well have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and youll be thrown from your saddle to die Or so Ill tell your mother Nothing would please me more Ser Allisers going to make me fight again tomorrow, isnt he?
jon	Yes, he is
sam	Im not going to get any better, you know?
jon	Well You cant get any worse -
littlefinger	I hear youre reading a boring book
ned	Pycelle talks too much
littlefinger	He never stops Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising Until recently, he was only a squire Jon Arryns squire He was knighted almost immediately after his masters untimely death
ned	Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
littlefinger	I promised Cat that Id help you
ned	Where is Ser Hugh? Ill speak to him
littlefinger	A singularly bad idea Do you see that boy there? One of Varyss little birds The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings Now look there That one belongs to the Queen And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
ned	Varys or the Queen?
littlefinger	No Shes one of mine Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
ned	Yes
littlefinger	The wiser answer was no, my Lord Get a message to this paragon of yours Discreetly Send him to question Ser Hugh After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel
ned	Why?
littlefinger	I have my observers, as I said, and its possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death
ned	Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you
littlefinger	Distrusting me was the wisest thing youve done since you climbed off your horse -
jory cassel	Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh
hugh of the vale	As you can see, Im busy
jory cassel	Im here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king Im the captain of his guard
hugh of the vale	Im sorry I didnt catch your name, Ser.
jory cassel	No ser Im not a knight
hugh of the vale	I see Well, it just so happens that I am -
jory cassel	He said hed be glad to talk to the Hand himself Hes a knight, you see
ned	A knight They strut around like roosters down here Even the ones whove never seen an arrow coming their way
jory cassel	You shouldnt be out here, my Lord Theres no telling who has eyes where
ned	Let them look
tobho mott	The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage
ned	What did Lord Arryn want?
tobho mott	He always came to see the boy
ned	Id like to see him as well
tobho mott	As you wish, my Lord Gendry! Here he is Strong for his age He works hard Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad
ned	This is fine work
gendry	Its not for sale
tobho mott	Boy, this is the Kings Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet.
gendry	I made it for me
tobho mott	Forgive him, my Lord
ned	Theres nothing to forgive When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
gendry	He just asked me questions is all, my Lord
ned	What kind of questions?
gendry	About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here But then he started asking me about my mother
ned	Your mother?
gendry	Who she was, what she looked like
ned	What did you tell him?
gendry	She died when I was little She had yellow hair Shed sing to me sometimes

jory cassel	Forgive me, my Lord.
jaime	Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
jory cassel	Weve met before, you know
jaime	Have we? Strange, Ive forgotten
jory cassel	The siege of Pyke We fought side by side one afternoon
jaime	Thats where you got your scar?
jory cassel	Aye One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye
jaime	Vicious sons of whores
jory cassel	They like their bloodshed
jaime	They stopped liking it at the end That was a proper battle Dyou remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
jory cassel	With his burning sword? Ill remember that till the day I die
jaime	I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop
jory cassel	Theon? Hes a good lad
jaime	I doubt it
robert	Ill bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it Come here
jory cassel	Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark
jaime	I dont serve Lord Stark -
grenn	Where have you been?
jon	Watch duty With Sam
pyp	Prince Porkchop Where is he?
jon	He wasnt hungry
pyp	Impossible
jon	Thats enough Sams no different from the rest of us There was no place for him in the world, so hes come here Were not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore Never again, no matter what Thorne says Hes our brother now and were going to protect him
rast	You are in love, Lord Snow You girls can do as you please But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, Im gonna slice me off a side of bacon.All of the new recruits are sleeping Jon, Ghost , Pyp and Grenn ambush and gag Rast as he sleeps Jon threatens him
jon	No one touches Sam
alliser thorne	What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there
grenn	Hit me Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield I yield
alliser thorne	You think this is funny, do you? When youre out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy? -
viserys	You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head
doreah	Forgive me, Khaleesi I did as you asked
daenerys	Hush now Its all right , take her and leave us
irri	Yes, Khaleesi
daenerys	Why did you hit her?
viserys	How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me
daenerys	I wasnt commanding you I just wanted to invite you to supper
viserys	Whats this?
daenerys	Its a gift I had it made for you
viserys	Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
daenerys	Please
viserys	This stinks of manure All of it
daenerys	Stop stop it
viserys	You would turn me into one of them, wouldnt you? Next youll want to braid my hair
daenerys	Youve no right to a braid Youve won no victories yet
viserys	You do not talk back to me
viserys	You are a horselords slut And now youve woken the dragon.
daenerys	I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands -
sam	I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Moles Town
jon	I wouldnt doubt it
sam	Dont you think its a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
jon	Sally on the side?
sam	Its silly, isnt it? What, we cant defend the Wall unless were celibate? Its absurd
jon	I didnt think youd be so upset about it
sam	Why not? Because Im fat? But I like girls just as much as you do They might not like me as much Ive never been with one Youve probably had hundreds
jon	As a matter of fact, Im the same as you
sam	I find that hard to believe
jon	I came very close once I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but.
sam	You didnt know where to put it?
jon	I know where to put it
sam	Was she Old and ugly?
jon	Young and gorgeous A whore named Ros
sam	What color hair?
jon	Red
sam	I like red hair And her Her.
jon	You dont want to know
sam	That good?
jon	Better
sam	Oh no So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect.
jon	Whats my name?
sam	?
jon	And why is my surname Snow?
sam	Because Youre a bastard from the north
jon	I never met my mother My father wouldnt even tell me her name I dont know if shes living or dead I dont know if shes a noblewoman or a fishermans wife Or a whore So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes But I couldnt do it Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? Its not a good life for a child
sam	So You didnt know where to put it?
alliser thorne	Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys
sam	It is a bit nippy
alliser thorne	A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors Its still summer Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldnt get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
jon	I build my own fires
alliser thorne	Thats admirable I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter It was supposed to be a two-week mission We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch So we went out to look for some of his men Capture them, gather some knowledge The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men Harder than youll ever be They know their country better than we do They knew there was a storm coming in So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass And we got caught in the open Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost And all in darkness You dont know cold Neither of you do The horses died first We didnt have enough to feed them, to keep them warm Eating the horses was easy But later when we started to fall That wasnt easy We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldnt we? Soft, fat boys like you Wed have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup Soon well have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Nights Watch, but youd be fools to believe it Youre boys still And come the winter you will die Like flies -
daenerys	I hit him I hit the dragon
jorah	Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake
daenerys	He is still the true King
jorah	The truth now do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?
daenerys	No But the common people are waiting for him Illyrio said theyre sewing dragon banners and praying for his return
jorah	The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends They dont care what games the high Lords play
daenerys	What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?
jorah	Home
daenerys	I pray for home too My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms He couldnt lead an army even if my husband gave him one Hell never take us home -
littlefinger	Lovers quarrel?
sansa	Im sorry Do I ?
septa mordane	Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish Hes known.
littlefinger	An old friend of the family Ive known your mother a long long time
arya	Why do they call you Littlefinger?
sansa	Arya
septa mordane	Dont be rude
littlefinger	No, its quite all right When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, its an exceedingly clever nickname
robert	Ive been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself
sansa	Gods, who is that?
littlefinger	Ser Gregor Clegane They call him the Mountain The Hounds older brother
sansa	And his opponent?
littlefinger	Ser Hugh of the Vale He was Jon Arryns squire Look how far hes come
robert	Yes, yes Enough of the bloody pomp Have at it
littlefinger	Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire Gregors toy, a wooden knight Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted There arent very many people who know that story
sansa	I wont tell anyone I promise
littlefinger	No, please dont If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, Im afraid all the knights in Kings Landing would not be able to save you -
jory cassel	My Lord, Her Grace the Queen
ned	Your Grace
cersei	Youre missing your tournament
ned	Putting my name on it doesnt make it mine
cersei	I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned How is Sansa?
ned	She likes it here
cersei	The only Stark who does Favors her mother, not much of the north in her
ned	What are you doing here?
cersei	I might ask the same of you What is it you hope to accomplish?
ned	ing called on me to serve him and the realm, and thats what Ill do until he tells me otherwise
cersei	You cant change him You cant help him Hell do what he wants, which is all hes ever done Youll try your best to pick up the pieces
ned	If thats my job, then so be it
cersei	Youre just a soldier, arent you? You take your orders and you carry on I suppose it makes sense Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow
ned	I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace
cersei	As was I -

barristan selmy	Life is strange Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident
ned	Im glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan as is my wife I dont think the widows life would suit her
barristan selmy	Youre too modest Ive seen you cut down a dozen great knights
ned	My father once told me you were the best hed ever seen I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat
barristan selmy	He was a fine man, your father What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime
ned	And that lad He was a squire until a few months ago How could he afford a new suit of armor?
barristan selmy	Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today
ned	Yes That will never happen
barristan selmy	Robert tends to do what he wants
ned	If the King got what he wanted all the time, wed still be fighting a damned rebellion
lancel	Its made too small, Your Grace It wont go
robert	Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains He cant even put a mans armor on him properly
ned	Youre too fat for your armor

ned	Youre torturing the poor boy
robert	You heard the Hand ings too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now

robert	All right, all right But you watch me out there I still know how to point a lance
ned	You have no business jousting Leave that for the young men
robert	Why? Because Im king? Piss on that I want to hit somebody

ned	Your squire A Lannister boy?
robert	Hmm A bloody idiot But Cersei insisted I have Jon Arryn to thank for her Cersei Lannister will make a good match , he told me Youll need her father on your side I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted Enough of this! Lets go watch em ride At least I can smell someone elses blood
ned	Robert?
robert	What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits! -

renly	Or you could even buy a friend
sansa	Hes going to die
ned	Ser Loras rides well
renly	Such a shame, Littlefinger It would have been so nice for you to have a friend
littlefinger	And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?

catelyn	I did often and loudly
tyrion	Very wise Theyll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place Words probably gotten to my father by now Hell be offering a handsome reward Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts Would you be so good as to untie me?
catelyn	And why would I do that?
tyrion	Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots Unless a Shadowcat ate me first
catelyn	Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns
tyrion	Ah the Eastern Road Were going to The Vale Youre taking me to your sisters to answer for my imagined crimes Tell me, Lady Stark When was the last time you saw your sister?
catelyn	Five years ago
tyrion	Shes changed She was always a bit touched, but now you might as well kill me here
catelyn	I am not a murderer, Lannister
tyrion	Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your sons life
catelyn	The dagger found
tyrion	What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?

maester luwin	Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family

maester luwin	Hmm If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback
bran	Really?
maester luwin	Dothraki boys learn when theyre four years old Why shouldnt you? -
theon	Shh Keep it down Youre not supposed to be inside the castle walls
ros	I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here
theon	Important enough for the likes of you
ros	Youre not the only nobleman in my life, you know
theon	Who? the Imp? Id call him half a nobleman
ros	Jealous?
theon	Why should I be jealous?
theon	Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night Whats a dwarf like down below? Ive always wondered
ros	Might surprise you
theon	Hmm?
ros	Hes good with his fingers too And his tongue
theon	Generous tipper I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister
ros	You are jealous
theon	Im a Greyjoy Weve been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years Theres not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters
ros	And what about the Starks?
theon	I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old
ros	A ward”, that’s a nice word for it Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again
theon	My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore
ros	You’re a very serious boy
theon	I’m not a boy
ros	Oh, yes you are A serious boy, with a serious cock
theon	I don’t want to pay for it
ros	Then get yourself a wife -
arya	Come on Im not gonna hurt you
varys	How is your son, my Lord?
ned	Hell never walk again
varys	But his mind is sound?
ned	So they say
varys	A blessing then I suffered an early mutilation myself Some doors close forever others open in the most unexpected places May I?
varys	If the wrong ears heard what Im about to tell you, off comes my head And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders But there are things you must know You are the Kings Hand and the King is a fool your friend, I know, but a fool and doomed unless you save him
ned	Ive been in the capital a month Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
varys	I didnt trust you
ned	So why do you trust me now?
varys	The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely There are few men of honor in the capital You are one of them I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem
ned	What sort of doom does the King face?
varys	The same sort as Jon Arryn The tears of Lys, they call it A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water It leaves no trace
ned	Who gave it to him?
varys	Some dear friend, no doubt But which one? There were many Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man There was one boy all he was he owed to Jon Arryn
ned	The squire, Ser Hugh?
varys	Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely
ned	If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?
varys	Someone who could afford it
ned	Jon was a man of peace He was Hand for 17 years 17 good years Why kill him?
varys	He started asking questions -
varys	Hes found one bastard already He has the book The rest will come
illyrio mopatis	And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
varys	The gods alone know The fools tried to kill his son Whats worse, they botched it The wolf and the lion will be at each others throats We will be at war soon, my friend
illyrio mopatis	What good is war now? Were not ready If one Hand can die, why not a second?
varys	This Hand is not the other
illyrio mopatis	We need time Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born You know how these savages are
varys	Delay, you say Move fast, I reply This is no longer a game for two players
illyrio mopatis	It never was -
varys	The first to arrive and the last to leave I admire your industry
littlefinger	You do move quietly
varys	We all have our qualities
littlefinger	You look a bit lonely today You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening First boy is on the house
varys	I think youre mistaking business with pleasure
littlefinger	Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations
varys	Oh, Im sure Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear
littlefinger	Im a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important
varys	Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
littlefinger	All desires are valid to a man with a full purse
varys	And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination The logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot
littlefinger	Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the Kings laws
varys	Strictly speaking
littlefinger	Tell me Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? Ive often wondered
varys	Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close But enough about me How have you been since we last saw each other?
littlefinger	Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
varys	Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King
littlefinger	Saw me with your own eyes?
varys	Eyes I own
littlefinger	Council business We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark
varys	Everyones well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Starks wife If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boys life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion To think A simple word to the Queen.
littlefinger	One shudders at the thought
varys	Oh
littlefinger	But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me
varys	Have you?
littlefinger	Yes Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers
varys	Was that you under the bed?
littlefinger	And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea Youre from there yourself, after all Were friends, arent we, Lord ? Id like to think we are So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friends sympathies To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm
varys	Oh, please
littlefinger	To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King -
renly	What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, youd best hurry up My brother is coming
littlefinger	To a small council meeting?
varys	Disturbing news from far away Havent you heard? -
guard	Off with you No begging
arya	Im not a beggar I live here
guard	Dyou want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
arya	I want to see my father

ned	You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop
arya	They said they were going to kill you
ned	Who did?
arya	I didnt see them, but I think one was fat
ned	Oh, Arya
arya	Im not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage something about the savage
ned	Where did you hear this?
arya	In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls
ned	What were you doing in the dungeons?
arya	Chasing a cat
jory cassel	Pardon, my Lord Theres a Nights Watchman here begging a word He says its urgent
ned	Your name, friend?

ned	Ah, well find recruits for you

jory cassel	Come along, my Lady You heard your father

vardis egen	Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
catelyn	There was no time to send word
vardis egen	May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?
catelyn	Thats why there was no time He is my prisoner
vardis egen	He doesnt look like a prisoner
catelyn	My sister will decide what he looks like
vardis egen	Yes, my Lady She will at that
tyrion	The Eyrie They say its impregnable
bronn	Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes Ill impregnate the bitch
tyrion	I like you -
steward	Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber A meeting has been called
ned	I need to see the King first alone
steward	ing is at the small council meeting, my Lord He has summoned you
ned	Is it about my wife?
steward	No, my Lord I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen
robert	The whore is pregnant
ned	Youre speaking of murdering a child
robert	I warned you this would happen Back in the North, I warned you, but you didnt care to hear Well, hear it now I want em dead, mother and child both And that fool, Viserys as well Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead
ned	You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this
robert	Honor?! Ive got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think its honor thats keeping the peace? Its fear! Fear and blood
ned	Then were no better than the Mad King
robert	Careful, Ned Careful now
ned	You want to assassinate a girl Because the Spider heard a rumor?
varys	No rumor, my Lord The princess is with child
ned	Based on whose information?
varys	Ser Jorah Mormont He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens
ned	Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
littlefinger	Jorah Mormonts a slaver, not a traitor Small difference, I know, to an honorable man
ned	He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land We commit murder on the word of this man?
robert	And if hes right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army What then?
ned	The Narrow Sea still lies between us Ill fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water
robert	Do nothing? Thats your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? Youre my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool
varys	I understand your misgivings, my Lord Truly, I do It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed
grand maester pycelle	I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
renly	We should have had them both killed years ago
littlefinger	When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with Cut her throat Be done with it
ned	I followed you into war twice, without doubts, without second thoughts But I will not follow you now The Robert I grew up with didnt tremble at the shadow of an unborn child
robert	She dies
ned	I will have no part in it
robert	Youre the Kings Hand, Lord Stark Youll do as I command or Ill find me a Hand who will
ned	And good luck to him I thought you were a better man
robert	Out! Out, damn you! Im done with you Go! Run back to Winterfell! Ill have your head on a spike! Ill put it there myself, you fool! You think youre too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war! -
ned	Ill go ahead with my daughters Get them ready Do it yourself Dont ask anyone for help
jory cassel	Right away, my Lord Lord Baelish is here for you
littlefinger	His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave The word treason was mentioned
ned	What can I do for you?
littlefinger	When do you return to Winterfell?
ned	Why? What do you care?
littlefinger	If youre still here come nightfall, Ill take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill If that sort of thing still interests you
ned	I dont have the time
littlefinger	It wont take more than an hour But as you please
ned	Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls chambers Who are your best two swords?
jory cassel	Heward and Wyl
ned	Find them and meet me at the stables -
lysa arryn	You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing You remember her, dont you? Isnt he beautiful? And strong too Jon knew it His last words were, the seed is strong He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale
catelyn	Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t
lysa arryn	To stay away from them! Not to bring one here
robin arryn	Mommy? Is that the bad man?
lysa arryn	It is
robin arryn	Hes little
lysa arryn	Hes Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister He killed your father He murdered the Hand of the King
tyrion	Oh? Did I kill him too? Ive been a very busy man
lysa arryn	You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale Every one of the loved Jon Arryn Every one of them would die for me
tyrion	If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do
robin arryn	You cant hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him
lysa arryn	Shh Shh Shh, my sweet boy Hes just trying to frighten us Lannisters are all liars No one will hurt my baby
robin arryn	Mommy I want to see the bad man fly
lysa arryn	Perhaps you will, my little love
catelyn	This man is my prisoner I will not have him harmed
lysa arryn	Ser Vardis, my sisters guest is weary Take him down below so he can rest Introduce him t
mord	You go sleep, dwarf man Sleep good, little dwarf man! -
loras	Lord Starks lucky he still has a head
renly	Robert will rant for a few days, but he wont do anything He adores the man
loras	Youre jealous
renly	Are you sure this wont hurt?
loras	Only if I slip
renly	And you prefer me like this?
loras	Mhmm
renly	If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy
loras	I want you
renly	My brother thinks that anyone who hasnt been to war isnt a man He treats me as if Im a spoiled child Oh, and youre not? , the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
loras	Hold still
renly	All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how Im not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood
loras	You did vomit when that boys eye was knocked out in the mêlée
renly	His eye was dangling out of the damn socket
loras	He shouldnt have entered the mêlée if he didnt know how to fight
renly	Easy for you to say Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman
loras	Its not a gift No one gave it to me Im good because I work at it every day of my life since I could hold a stick
renly	I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you
loras	Yes well, I guess well never know
renly	Everywhere?
loras	Everywhere So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
renly	It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is Roberts rather tasteless about it Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches
loras	Its a shame he cant muster the same enthusiasm for his wife
renly	He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money
loras	I have an outrageous amount of money
renly	Not as much as the Lannisters
loras	But a lot more than you
renly	Roberts threatening to take me hunting with him Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day All so he can stick his spear into somethings flesh! Oh but Robert loves his killing And hes the King
loras	Hmm How did that ever happen?
renly	Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it
loras	Do you know who should be King?
renly	Be serious
loras	I am My father could be your bank Ive never fought in a war before, but Id fight for you
renly	Im fourth in line
loras	And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster Tommen is eight
renly	Stannis?
loras	Stannis has the personality of a lobster
renly	Hes still my older brother
renly	What are you doing?
loras	Look at it
renly	You cut me
loras	Its just blood Weve all got it in us Sometimes a little spills If you become King, youre going to see a lot of this You need to get used to it Go on Look People love you They love to serve you because youre kind to them They want to be near you
loras	Youre willing to do what needs to be done, but you dont gloat over it You dont love killing Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared You would be a wonderful King -
cersei	Im sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didnt work out You seemed so good together
robert	Im glad I could do something to make you happy
cersei	Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces
robert	I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime
cersei	No Hes not serious enough Ill say this for Ned Stark hes serious enough Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
robert	I dont know But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea We wont be able to stop them
cersei	The Dothraki dont sail Every child knows that They dont have discipline They dont have armor They dont have siege weapons
robert	Its a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your fathers voice comes out
cersei	Is my father wrong?
robert	Lets say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back We hole up in our castles, a wise move Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field They leave us in our castles They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who cant hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all
cersei	We still outnumber them
robert	Which is the bigger number five or one?
cersei	Five
robert	Five one One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose Our purpose died with the Mad King Now weve got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse And everybody wants something different Your father wants to own the world Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow
cersei	What do you want?
robert	We havent had a real fight in nine years Back-stabbing doesnt prepare you for a fight And thats all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing Sometimes I dont know what holds it together
cersei	Our marriage
robert	Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together Dont you get tired?
cersei	Every day
robert	How long can hate hold a thing together?
cersei	Well, seventeen years is quite a long time
robert	Yes, it is
cersei	Yes, it tis What was she like?
robert	Youve never asked about her, not once Why not?
cersei	At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her I thought if I didnt talk about her, shed just fade away for you When I realized that wasnt going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite I didnt want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask And eventually it became clear that my spite didnt mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it
robert	So why now?
cersei	What harm could Lyanna Starks ghost do to either of us that we havent done to each other a hundred times over?
robert	You want to know the horrible truth? I cant even remember what she looked like I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldnt fill the hole she left behind
cersei	I felt something for you once, you know?
robert	I know
cersei	Even after we lost our first boy for quite a while, actually Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment?
robert	No Does that make you feel better or worse?
cersei	It doesnt make me feel anything -
mhaegen	She looks like him, dont she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair
ned	Aye
mhaegen	Tell him when you see him, my Lord If it please you Tell him how beautiful she is
ned	I will
mhaegen	And tell him Ive been with no one else I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new I dont want no jewels or nothing, just him ing was always good to me
ned	When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
mhaegen	He wasnt that sort of man, my Lord He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy
ned	She looks healthy enough to me The girl shall want for nothing
littlefinger	Brothels make a much better investment than ship, Ive found Whores rarely sink
ned	What do you know of King Roberts bastards?
littlefinger	Well, he has more than you, for a start
ned	How many?
littlefinger	Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents
ned	And Jon Arryn tracked them all down Why?
littlefinger	He was the Kings Hand Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after He was overcome with fatherly love
ned	Come
ned	Jory
jory cassel	My Lord
jaime	Such a small pack of wolves
jory cassel	Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King
jaime	Was! the Hand of the King Now Im not sure what he is Lord of somewhere very far away
littlefinger	Whats the meaning of this, Lannister?
jaime	Get back inside where its safe Im looking for my brother You remember my brother, dont you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man
ned	I remember him well
jaime	It seems he had some trouble on the road You wouldnt know what happened to him, would you?
ned	He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes
littlefinger	My Lords! Ill bring the City Watch
jaime	Come, Stark Id rather you die sword in hand
jory cassel	If you threaten my Lord again.
jaime	Threaten? As in, Im going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?
ned	You kill me, your brothers a dead man
jaime	Youre right Take him alive! Kill his men
ned	Your pardon, your Grace
cersei	Do you know what your wife has done?
ned	She did nothing I did not command
robert	Who’d have thought she had it in her?
cersei	By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
ned	I am the King’s Hand
cersei	You were the King’s Hand
ned	trying to keep the peace
cersei	You shall now be held accountable
robert	Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you’ll make your peace with Jaime
ned	He butchered my men
cersei	Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime
robert	Quiet, woman
ned	Jaime has fled the city Give me leave to bring him back to justice
cersei	I took you for a king
robert	Hold your tongue
cersei	He’s attacked my brother and abducted the other I should wear the armor and you the gown
cersei	I shall wear this like a badge of honor
robert	Wear it in silence or I’ll honor you again
robert	See what she does to me? My loving wife I should not have hit her That was not That was not kingly
ned	If we don’t act there will be a war
robert	So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King’s Landing She’s had her fun, now put an end to it You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it
ned	And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
robert	I’m half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father I don’t know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits I don’t want to know This is what matters I can’t rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other’s throats, so enough
ned	As you command your Grace With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight
robert	Piss on that! Send a raven I want you to stay I’m the king, I get what I want I never loved my brothers A sad thing for a man to admit, but it’s true You were the brother I chose We’ll talk when I return from the hunt
ned	The hunt?
robert	Killing things clears my head You’ll have to sit on the throne while I’m away You’ll hate it more than I do
ned	The Targaryen girl
robert	Seven hells! Don’t start with her again! The girl will die and I’ll hear no more of it Put on the badge And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I’ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister -

robb	You’re talking about war

robb	Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army
theon	A Lannister put his spear through your father’s leg ingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch

ned	You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane
grand maester pycelle	Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight
littlefinger	I’ve heard him called Tywin Lannister’s mad dog.” I’m sure you have as well Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
grand maester pycelle	If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection, it would be
littlefinger	It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital
grand maester pycelle	Wel
ned	I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert Lord Beric Dondarrion
ned	You shall have the command Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep
beric dondarrion	As you command
ned	In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes I denounce him and attaint him I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death
grand maester pycelle	My lord This This is a drastic action It would be better to wait for King Robert’s return
grand maester pycelle	My Lord
ned	Send a raven to Casterly Rock Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm
littlefinger	A bold move, my Lord, and admirable But is it wise to yank the lion’s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms Gold wins wars, not soldiers
ned	Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister? -
robin arryn	Is it over?
lysa arryn	You don’t fight with honor

viserys	Tell him I want what was bargained for or I’m taking you back He can keep the baby I’ll cut it out and leave it for him
viserys	What’s he saying?
daenerys	He says yes You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold
viserys	That was all I wanted W-what was promised
viserys	No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh
jorah	Look away Khaleesi
daenerys	No
viserys	No Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can’t
viserys	Dany please
khal drogo	A crown for a king
jorah	Khaleesi
daenerys	He was no dragon Fire cannot kill a dragon
jaime	Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain Uh, arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown Poor Ned Stark Brave man, terrible judgment
tywin	Attacking him was stupid
tywin	Lannisters dont act like fools Are you gonna say something clever? Go on, say something clever
jaime	Catelyn Stark took my brother
tywin	Why is he still alive?
jaime	Tyrion?
tywin	Ned Stark
jaime	One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him
tywin	Why is he still alive?
jaime	It wouldnt have been clean
tywin	Clean.
tywin	You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you
jaime	I could care less what anyone thinks of me
tywin	Now thats what you want people to think of you
jaime	Its the truth
tywin	When you hear them whispering Kingslayer behind your back, doesnt it bother you?
jaime	Of course it bothers me
tywin	The lion doesnt concern himself with the opinions of the sheep I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness Im giving you half of our forces 30,000 men You will bring them to Catelyn Starks girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts
jaime	I didnt realize you placed such a high value on my brothers life
tywin	Hes a Lannister He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but hes one of us And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect
jaime	So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of
tywin	No, its not an opinion, its a fact! If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared Your mothers dead Before long Ill be dead And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground Its the family name that lives on Its all that lives on Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family Do you understand?
tywin	Hmm Youre blessed with abilities that few men possess You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms And you are still blessed with youth And what have you done with these blessings, huh? Youve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings One a madman, the other a drunk The future of our family will be determined in these next few months We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did I need you to become a man you were always meant to be Not next year Not tomorrow Now
cersei	Youre in pain
ned	Ive had worse, my lady
cersei	Perhaps its time to go home
ned	The South doesnt seem to agree with you
ned	I know the truth Jon Arryn died for
cersei	Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
ned	Has he done this before?
cersei	Jaime would have killed him
cersei	My brother is worth a thousand of your friend
ned	Your brother Or your lover?
cersei	The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure
cersei	Jaime and I are more than brother and sister We shared a womb We came into this world together We belong together
ned	My son saw you with him
cersei	Do you love your children?
ned	With all my heart
cersei	No more than I love mine
ned	And they are all Jaimes
cersei	Thank the Gods In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways In the morning, he doesnt remember
ned	Youve always hated him
cersei	Hated him? I worshiped him Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, Lyanna Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me
ned	When the King returns from his hunt, Ill tell him the truth You must be gone by then You and your children I will not have their blood on my hands Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can Because wherever you go, Roberts wrath will follow you
cersei	And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself Jaime told me about the day Kings Landing fell He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself Such a sad mistake
ned	Ive made many mistakes in my life, but that wasnt one of them
cersei	Oh, but it was When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die There is no middle ground
ros	Come here Oh yes, oh Oh yes yes yes
littlefinger	No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you wherever youre from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that Im saying?
ros	Yes, My Lord
littlefinger	Lets start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman Well, go ahead Slowly Youre not fooling them They just paid you They know what you are They know its all just an act Your job is to make them forget what they know That takes time You need to Ease into it Go ahead Ease into it Hes winning you over in spite of yourself Youre starting to like this He wants to believe you Hes enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it Why shouldnt you? He knows hes better than other men Hes always known it deep down inside Now he has proof Hes so good, hes reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there Overcoming your very nature
ros	Why dont you join us, My Lord?
littlefinger	Im saving myself for another
ros	What she doesnt know wont hurt her
littlefinger	A stupid saying What we dont know is usually what gets us killed
ros	She must be very beautiful
littlefinger	No, not really Impeccable bloodlines though
ros	I do believe my lords in love
littlefinger	For many years Most of my life really Play with her ass And she loved me too I was her little confidant, her plaything She could tell me anything, anything at all She told me about all the horses that she liked The castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry A northerner with a jaw like an anvil So I challenged him to a duel I mean, why not? Id read all the stories The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories In the end, she wouldnt even let him kill me Hes just a boy , she said Please dont hurt him So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went
ros	Is she still married to him?
littlefinger	Oh no He got himself killed before the wedding And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen She loves him, Im afraid And why wouldnt she? I mean, who could compare to him? Hes just so good Do you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that Ill never win Not that way Thats their game, their rules Im not going to fight them Im going to fuck them Thats what I know Thats what I am And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want
ros	And what do you want?
littlefinger	Oh, everything, my dear Everything there is Now wash yourselves Both of you are working tonight Hmm
sraw theon	Youre a very lucky girl Do you know that? Where I come from, we dont show mercy to criminals Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord, at low tide wed lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes The sea would come in closer and closer Youd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time
osha	Where is it you come from?
theon	The Iron Islands
osha	They far away?
theon	Youve never heard of the Iron Islands?
osha	Trust me, youve never heard where Im from neither
theon	Trust me, My Lord Youre not living in the wilderness anymore In civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles
osha	And whats that?
theon	Lord
osha	Why?
theon	Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands
osha	Whats that got to do with you? If your fathers lord, how can you be lord too?
theon	I will be lord after my father
osha	So youre not lord now?
theon	No, you You having a go at me? Is that it?
osha	I just dont understand how you Southerners do things
theon	Im not a Southerner
osha	Youre from South of the wall That makes you a Southerner to me
theon	Youre an impudent little wench, arent you?
osha	Couldnt say, My Lord Dont know what impunent means
theon	Impudent It means rude Disrespectful Do you want to lose that chain?
maester luwin	! The lady is our guest
theon	I thought she was our prisoner
maester luwin	Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
maester luwin	Chances are I wont be nearby the next time that happens
osha	Im used to worse than him
osha	Im used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones
maester luwin	Why did you come here?
osha	Didnt mean to come here Meant to get much further South than this As far South as South goes, before the long night comes
maester luwin	Why? What are you afraid of?
osha	Theres things that sleep in the day and hunt at night
maester luwin	Owls and Shadowcats and.
osha	Im not talking about Owls and Shadowcats
maester luwin	The things you speak of theyve been gone for thousands of years
osha	They wasnt gone, old man They was sleeping And they aint sleeping no more

robert	Give it to the council after Im dead At least theyll say I did this right, this one thing Youll rule now Youll hate it worse than I did, but youll do it well The girl, Daenerys You were right Varys, Littlefinger, my brother Worthless No one to tell me no but you Only you Let her live Stop it, if its not too late

ned	Give him milk of the poppy
barristan selmy	He was reeling from the wine He commanded us to step aside, but I failed him
ned	No man could have protected him from himself
varys	I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?
barristan selmy	His squire, from the kings own skin
ned	His squire? The Lannister boy?
varys	Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself
ned	His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them At once
varys	Im afraid those birds have flown.The girl is likely dead already
khal drogo	The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs
daenerys	According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world
khal drogo	The earth ends at the black salt sea No horse can cross the poison water
daenerys	The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea The dirt where I was born
khal drogo	Not dirt Lands
daenerys	Lands, yes There are thousands of ships in the free cities Wooden horses that fly across the sea
khal drogo	Lets speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs
daenerys	Its not a chair Its a.
thronekhal drogo	Throne?
daenerys	A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen
khal drogo	A King does not need a chair to sit upon He only needs a horse
daenerys	Cant you help me make him understand?
jorah	The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons Have patience, Khaleesi We will go home, I promise you
daenerys	My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms Have I said something funny, Ser?
jorah	Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didnt seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right He had no right to them He seized them because he could
daenerys	And because he had dragons
jorah	Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier
daenerys	You dont believe it
jorah	Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report As for the rest It was 300 years ago Who knows what really happened? Now if youll pardon me, Ill seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me
daenerys	Well, Ill come with you
jorah	No no, dont trouble yourself Enjoy the market Ill rejoin you soon enough

daenerys	Is something wrong?
jorah	I have a thirst Open it
wine merchant	The wine is for the Khaleesi Its not for the likes of you
jorah	Open it
jorah	Pour
wine merchant	It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe
daenerys	Do as he says
wine merchant	As the princess commands
wine merchant	Sweet, isnt it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue
jorah	You first
wine merchant	Me? Im afraid I am not worthy of the vintage Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares
daenerys	You will drink
doreah	Khaleesi! Stop him
jorah	Come Not much, really But theres food

jeor	Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
sam	No, my lord I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.Alliser ThorneL Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?

jon	Will I serve the Lord Commanders meals and fetch hot water for his bath
maester aemon	Certainly And keep a fire burning in his chambers Change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you
jon	Do you take me for a servant?
maester aemon	We took you for a man of The Nights Watch But perhaps we were wrong in that
jon	May I go?
maester aemon	As you wish
sam	Jon, wait! Dont you see what theyre doing?
jon	I see Ser Allisers revenge, thats all He wanted it and he got it Stewards are nothing but maids! Im a better swordsman and rider than any of you! Its not fair
pypar	Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock I pushed him away and he said hed have my hands cut off for stealing their silver So now Im here At the end of the world with no one to sing for, but old men and little shits like you Ill never see my family again Ill never be inside a woman again So dont tell me about fair
sam	I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
pypar	You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
sam	Could you sing me a song, Pyp? Id like to hear a song
sam	Now listen to me The old man is the Lord Commander of The Nights Watch Youll be with him day and night Yes, youll clean his clothes.But youll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle Youll know everything, be part of everything And he asked for you himself He wants to groom you for command
jon	I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger
sam	I always wanted to be a Wizard What? No, Im serious So youll stay and say your words with me?
renly	She wont care Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command
ned	And what should I do with a hundred swords?
renly	Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us
ned	What about Stannis?
renly	Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis? You have odd notions about protecting the realm
ned	Stannis is your older brother
renly	This isnt about the bloody line of succession That didnt matter when you rebelled against the Mad King It shouldnt matter now Whats best for the Kingdoms? Whats best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is He inspires no love or loyalty Hes not a King I am
ned	Stannis is a commander Hes led men into war twice He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet
renly	Yes, hes a good soldier Everyone knows that So was Robert
tell me something	Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
ned	I will not dishonor Roberts last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds
ned	You will sail to dragonstone tonight You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife Only Stannis himself
tomard	Yes, My Lord
ned	Now leave us
littlefinger	My Lord protector
ned	ing has no true born sons Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannisters bastards
littlefinger	So when the King dies.
ned	The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis
littlefinger	So it would seem Unless.
ned	There is no unless He is the rightful heir Nothing can change that
littlefinger	And he cannot take the throne without your help You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds
ned	Do you have a shred of honor?
littlefinger	You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm All of the power is yours You need only reach out and take it Make peace with the Lannisters Release the Imp Wed your daughter to Joffrey We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead
ned	We?
littlefinger	Youll need someone to share these burdens I assure you, my price would be modest
ned	What you suggest is treason
littlefinger	Only if we lose
ned	Make peace with the Lannisters, you say With the people who tried to murder my boy
ned	No I wont do it
littlefinger	So it will be Stannis and war?
ned	There is no other choice He is the heir
littlefinger	So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly
ned	You promised Catelyn you would help me The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard I need the gold cloaks The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the Kings peace
littlefinger	Look at you You know what you want me to do You know it has to be done, but its not honorable so the words stick in your throat When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect? Who do they follow? The man who pays them
daenerys	I thought hed leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.He will never leave you alone If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him He will never abandon the hunt Youre a Targaryen The last Targaryen Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him
daenerys	He will not have my son
khal drogo	Moon of my life Are you hurt?
khal drogo	Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.I make this gift to you And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world I will also pledge a gift
king joffrey	Liar
cersei	You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark Ser Barristan, seize this traitor
ned	Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man Do him no harm
cersei	You think he stands alone?
king joffrey	Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it
ned	Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard
janos slynt	Men of the Watch

ned	What about my daughters?
varys	The younger one seems to have escaped the castle Even my little birds cannot find her
ned	And Sansa?
varys	Still engaged to Joffrey Cersei will keep her close The rest of your household though, all dead, it grieves me to say I do so hate the sight of blood
ned	You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing
varys	And would again, My Lord I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords When you look at me do you see a hero? What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffreys birth?
ned	The madness of mercy That she might save her children
varys	Ah, the children It is always the innocents who suffer It wasnt the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
ned	The Queen cant kill me Cat holds her brother
varys	The wrong brother sadly And lost to her Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers
ned	If thats true, then slit my throat and be done with it
varys	Not today, My Lord

greatjon umber	No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannisters siege of Riverrun Do that and the River Lords will join us
robb	To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins
theon	Lord Frey controls that bridge Your fathers bannerman
catelyn	The late Lord Frey my father calls him At the Trident, he didnt appear until the battle was done Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others

barristan selmy	Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood Our vows are taken for life Only death relieves us of our sacred trust
cersei	Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your Kings?
king joffrey	You let my father die Youre too old to protect anybody
barristan selmy	Your Grace.
cersei	The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

cersei	Careful, Ser
varys	We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need
barristan selmy	A hall to die in and men to bury me I am a Knight I shall die a Knight

kings landing page	The Lady Sansa of House Stark
cersei	Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
sansa	I do
sansa	As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King
grand maester pycelle	Treason is a noxious weed It should be torn out, root.
king joffrey	Let her speak I want to hear what she says
sansa	Thank you, Your Grace
littlefinger	Do you deny your fathers crime?
sansa	No, My Lords I know he must be punished All I ask is mercy I know My Lord father must regret what he did He was King Roberts friend and he loved him You all know he loved him He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him They must have lied to him Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody They must have lied
king joffrey	He said I wasnt the King Why did he say that?
sansa	He was badly hurt Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy He wasnt himself Otherwise h never would have said it
varys	A childs faith Such sweet innocence And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes

varys	Youve seen better days, my lord
ned	Another visit? lt seems youre my last friend
varys	No, no, many still love you Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life
ned	On her knees begging for me Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
varys	You do me wrong, my lord Your blood is the last thing l want
ned	l dont know what you want lve given up trying to guess
varys	When l was still a boy before they cut my balls off with a hot knife l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities They taught me that each man has a role to play The same is true at court l am the master of whisperers My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples lm a good actor, my lord
ned	Huh Can you free me from this pit?
varys	l could But will l? No As l said, Im no hero
ned	What do you want? Tell me No riddles, no stories Tell me, what do you want?
varys	Peace Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad Fighting for his fathers freedom
ned	Robb? Hes just a boy
varys	Boys have been conquerors before But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the kings the late kings brother Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy
ned	Stannis Baratheon is Roberts true heir The throne is his by rights
varys	Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life lt would be a shame to throw it away Cersei is no fool She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one
ned	You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
varys	l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir Cersei knows you as a man of honor lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son
ned	You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of of what? You grew up with actors You learned their craft and you learnt it well But l grew up with soldiers l learned how to die a long time ago
varys	Pity Such a pity What of your daughters life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you? e
robb	lts a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda
theon	Or so Walder Frey would have you think
catelyn	Keep shooting them down We cant risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters
robb	Hes Grandfathers bannerman We cant expect his support?
greatjon umber	Expect nothing of Walder Frey and youll never be surprised Look
robb	Father rots in a dungeon How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now
theon	Just march up to his gates and tell him youre crossing Weve got five times his numbers You can take the Twins if you have to
greatjon umber	Not in time Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak
catelyn	The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll
robb	Have my horse saddled and ready
greatjon umber	Enter the Twins alone and hell sell you to the Lannisters as he likes
theon	Or throw you in a dungeon Or slit your throat
robb	My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing Whatever it took lf lm going to lead this army, l cant have other men doing my bargaining for me
catelyn	l agree lll go
everyone	You cant
catelyn	l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl He would never harm me
greatjon umber	Unless there was a profit in it er
walder frey	What do you want?

walder frey	Huh Didnt come to the last one, either Or the one before that Your family has always pissed on me
catelyn	My lord, l
walder frey	Dont deny it You know its true The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine
catelyn	lm sure there were reasons
walder frey	l didnt need reasons l needed to get rid of sons and daughters You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
catelyn	To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way
walder frey	Why should l let him?
catelyn	lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls
walder frey	There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here Dont try and frighten me, Lady Stark Your husbands in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your sons got no fur to keep his balls warm
catelyn	You swore an oath to my father
walder frey	Oh, yes, l said some words And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right Joffreys king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, ld hand you both over to the Lannisters
catelyn	Why dont you?
walder frey	Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you? -
voices outside	And engage
jeor	When does Aemon think youll be able to use that hand?
jon	Soon, he says
jeor	Good Youll be ready for this, then l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made lts called Longclaw Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think
jon	This is Valyrian steel
jeor	lt was my fathers sword, his father before him The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries lt was meant for my son Jorah He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros
jon	My lord, you honor me, but l cant
jeor	Oh, you can And you will l wouldnt be standing here if it wasnt for you and your beast A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so youll take it lll hear no more about it ls that understood?
jon	Yes, my lord
jeor	Right Now, dont think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne Thats a mans sword ltll take a man to wield it
jon	lll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight
jeor	No, you wont l sent him to Kings Landing yesterday The hand that your wolf tore off that things wrist – lve ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king That should get young Joffreys attention And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper
jon	Yes, my lord Unidentified Night
watchers	Well done Well done.Night
watcher	You earned that, Snow.Night
watcher	Well done

sam	lm really not supposed to say
jon	And yet you really want to say You want to say that
sam	There was a raven l read the message to Maester Aemon lts your brother Robb
jon	What? What about him?
sam	Hes heading south To war All his bannermen have rallied to his side, theyll keep him safe
jon	l should be there l should be with him -
greatjon umber	lf we do that, theyll never get back across
robb	Well? What did he say?
catelyn	Lord Walder has granted your crossing His men are yours, as well
robb	Huh
catelyn	Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you
robb	What does he want in return?
catelyn	You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire He expects a knighthood in good time
robb	Fine, fine And?
catelyn	And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age
robb	She wont be happy about that And?
catelyn	And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters Whichever you prefer He has a number he thinks will be suitable

catelyn	Not if you want to cross
robb	Then l consent -
jon	Sam said you wanted to see me?
maester aemon	l did indeed Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Nights Watch take no wives and father no children?
jon	No
maester aemon	So they will not love Love is the death of duty lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
jon	He would do whatever was right, no matter what
maester aemon	Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000 Most of us are not so strong What is honor compared to a womans love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brothers smile?
jon	Sam told you
maester aemon	Were all human Oh, we all do our duty when theres no cost to it Honor comes easy then Yet sooner or later in every mans life there comes a day when it is not easy A day when he must choose
jon	And this is my day? ls that what youre saying?
maester aemon	Oh, it hurts, boy Oh, yes l know
jon	You do not know No one knows l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother
maester aemon	The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows They waited till l was old What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail But when l heard they had killed my brothers son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children
jon	Who are you?
maester aemon	My father was Maekar, the first of his name My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King
jon	Youre Aemon Targaryen
maester aemon	lm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Nights Watch l will not tell you to stay or go You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days As l have -
daenerys	My lord My sun and stars Drogo
khal drogo	My horse
cohollo	Blood of my blood
khal drogo	No, l must ride

daenerys	Hes tired, thats all He needs to rest Weve ridden far enough today Well camp here
qotho	This is no place to camp A woman does not give us orders Not even a Khaleesi
daenerys	Well camp here Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it
qotho	You do not command me, Khaleesi
daenerys	Find Mirri Maz Duur Bring her to me

qotho	Hyah! Hyah!
kevan	Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Freys levies in tow Theyre a days march north
tywin	The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage
tyrion	Oh, do continue Didnt mean to interrupt
tywin	l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise weve wasted good steel on them
kevan	The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes Heavy black steel, double-sided
tyrion	Shagga likes axes
tywin	When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard
tyrion	The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
kevan	They do seem rather ferocious
tyrion	Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay
tywin	When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander
tyrion	Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort
tywin	Therell be no more discussion on the matter
tyrion	lt appears lm not hungry after all Excuse me, my lords.Back at his tent, Tyrion finds Bronn there with a woman waiting there too
tyrion	Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
bronn	l took her
tyrion	Took her? From whom?
bronn	From, uh, Ser Whats-his-name? l dont know Ginger cunt, three tents down
tyrion	And he didnt have anything to say about it?
bronn	He said something
tyrion	Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically Well be at the vanguard tomorrow
bronn	Oh, well l, uh, think lll go and find myself one
tyrion	Who are you?

tyrion	What did your mother call you?
prostitute	Shae What did your mother call you?

shae	And what do l get?
tyrion	One safety No one will hurt you for as long as youre mine Two the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular
shae	Who told you this? Women you paid?
tyrion	And three more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years Do you accept my proposal?
shae	Lets start with your last night in this world Back across the Narrow Sea Drogo is mumbling incoherently in Dothraki inside a tent, Daenerys by his side
jorah	Khaleesi
daenerys	Come Hes very strong No one understands how strong he is

daenerys	l have never been nothing l am the blood of the dragon
qotho	The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi
daenerys	l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser
jorah	l think youre right
mirri maz duur	Youve saved me once more
daenerys	And now you must save him
mirri maz duur	Hes beyond the healers skills All l can do is ease his path
daenerys	Save him and l will free you l swear it You must know a way Some – some magic
mirri maz duur	There is a spell Some would say death is cleaner
daenerys	Do it Save him
mirri maz duur	There is a price

bronn	You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers
tyrion	Another night, perhaps
shae	Not another night This night
tyrion	lts not a pleasant story
shae	Oh, maybe l will cry
bronn	lm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship
tyrion	So l was 16 My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her Her name was Tysha She was a wheelwrights orphan And she was hungry Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine l forgot how afraid l was around girls how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother l forgot about everything but Tysha And somehow l found myself in her bed
bronn	For three chickens, l should hope so
tyrion	lt didnt last long l didnt know what the hell l was doing But she was good to me She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it man and wife For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father
bronn	Well, l imagine that was the end of all that
tyrion	Not quite First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth The girl was a whore, you see Jaime had arranged the whole thing the road, the rapers, all of it He thought it was time l had a woman After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards He paid her well a silver for each man How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor
bronn	l would have killed the man who did that to me
shae	You should have known she was a whore
tyrion	Really? l was 16, drunk and in love
shae	A girl who was almost raped doesnt invite another man into her bed two hours later
tyrion	As l said, l was young and stupid
shae	You are still young and stupid
tyrion	What is it? What do you want?
bronn	Youre sleeping through the war
tyrion	What?
bronn	They stole a nights march on us Theyre a mile north
tyrion	Get my squire
bronn	You dont have a squire
tyrion	lf l die, weep for me
shae	Youll be dead How will you know?
tyrion	lll know
soldier	Watch out! Move
soldier	Out of the way! Move aside
bronn	Stay low
tyrion	Stay low?
bronn	lf youre lucky, no one will notice you
tyrion	l was born lucky Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours! Tribesmen of the Vale Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man
tyrion	To battle
bronn	Youre a shit warrior
tyrion	lm alive?
bronn	Youre alive
tyrion	Did we win?
bronn	We wouldnt be having this conversation if we didnt
tyrion	How did our tribesmen do?
bronn	Yeah, good
tyrion	lts nice to see them getting along
tywin	Youre wounded
tyrion	Good of you to notice l hear we won
tywin	Huh! The scouts were wrong There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20
tyrion	Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
tywin	He wasnt here
tyrion	Where was he?
tywin	With his other 18,000 men
tyrion	And where are they? -
rodrik cassel	We should go, my lady
catelyn	No
rodrik cassel	My lady
bannermen	Hyah! Hyah
robb	By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened
jaime	Lady Stark ld offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it
catelyn	lt is not your sword l want Give me my daughters back Give me my husband
jaime	lve lost them too, lm afraid
theon	Kill him, Robb Send his head to his father He cut down ten of our men You saw him
robb	Hes more use to us alive than dead
catelyn	Take him away and put him in irons
jaime	We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters Swords or lances, teeth, nails choose your weapons and lets end this here and now
robb	lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, youd win Were not doing it your way
greatjon umber	Come on, pretty man
robb	l sent 2,000 men to their graves today
theon	The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice
robb	Aye But the dead wont hear them One victory does not make us conquerors Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over

grand maester pycelle	As we sin, so do we suffer This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
joffrey	My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Nights Watch Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father But they have the soft hearts of women So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished Ser Ilyn, bring me his head

joffrey	Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his hand, leaving her lip bloodied Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below She moves forward to lunge him from the edge, but she’s stopped by the Hound
sandor clegane	Here, girl
joffrey	Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? lll look for you in court
sandor clegane	Save yourself some pain, girl Give him what he wants
sandor clegane	Youll be needing that again -
jonos bracken	The proper course is clear pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his
robb	Renly is not the king
jonos bracken	You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord He put your father to death
robb	That doesnt make Renly king Hes Roberts youngest brother lf Bran cant be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly cant be king before Stannis
jonos bracken	Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
galbart glover	Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis
greatjon umber	My Lords My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldnt we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to the King in the North
rickard kar	lll have peace on those terms They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too ing in the North

catelyn	Leave us
jaime	You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark Widowhood becomes you Your bed must be lonely ls that why you came? lm not at my best, but l think l could be of service You slip out of that gown and well see if lm up to it Oh, l do like a violent woman
catelyn	l will kill you tonight, Ser Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister
jaime	Let me show you how Hit me again, over the ear And again and again Youre stronger than you look, it shouldnt take long
catelyn	That is what you want the world to believe, isnt it? That you dont fear death
jaime	But l dont, my lady The dark is coming for all of us Why cry about it?
catelyn	Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just
jaime	What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
catelyn	Because of men like you
jaime	There are no men like me Only me
catelyn	My son Bran How did he come to fall from that tower?

cersei	Stop talking Get back into bed
tywin	They have my son

leo lefford	lve heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses
addam marbrand	ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
kevan	Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us Jaime captured, his armies scattered lts a catastrophe Perhaps we should sue for peace
tyrion	Theres your peace Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Starks head Youll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now Hes winning – in case you hadnt noticed
kevan	lm told we still have his sisters
leo lefford	The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime
kevan	First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise
tywin	They have my son! Get out, all of you Not you You were right about Eddard Stark lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Roberts brothers But now – madness Madness and stupidity l always thought you were a stunted fool Perhaps l was wrong
tyrion	Half wrong lm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we cant stay here
tywin	No one will stay here Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Gods Eye to the Red Fork The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal And you will go to Kings Landing
tyrion	And do what?
tywin	Rule You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle
tyrion	Heads, spikes, walls Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?
tywin	Youre my son Oh, one more thing You will not take that whore to court Do you understand?

mirri maz duur	Monstrous, twisted l pulled him out myself He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat When l touched him the skin fell from his bones Inside he was full of graveworms l warned you that only death can pay for life You knew the price
daenerys	Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me Show me what l bought with my sons life
mirri maz duur	As you command, lady Come l will take you to him
jorah	Time enough for that later

jorah	He seems to like the warmth, Princess
mirri maz duur	He lives You asked for life, you paid for life
daenerys	This is not life When will he be as he was?
mirri maz duur	When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east When the seas go dry When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves
daenerys	Leave us
jorah	l dont want you alone with this sorceress
daenerys	l have nothing more to fear from this woman Go
daenerys	You knew what l was buying and you knew the price
mirri maz duur	lt was wrong of them to burn my temple lt angered the Great Shepherd
daenerys	This is not Gods work My child was innocent
mirri maz duur	lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World Now he will burn no cities Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust
daenerys	l spoke for you l saved you
mirri maz duur	Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl l saw my gods house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
daenerys	Your life
mirri maz duur	Why dont you take a look at your khal Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone -

daenerys	When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars In King’s Landing, Pycelle is having a conversation with someone in his bedchambers
grand maester pycelle	Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, lve known truly known more kings than any man alive Theyre complicated men, but l know how to serve them Yes, and keep on serving them Aerys Targaryen Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst He was a good man Such a charmer To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign
grand maester pycelle	He is a capable young man Strong military mind Stern But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice lts far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King Mmm True greatness
ros	So whats the thing?
grand maester pycelle	What thing?
ros	About kings You said, The thing you need to understand about kings
grand maester pycelle	What? Things? What?

varys	When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
littlefinger	lts hard for them to simper and bow without heads
varys	A man with great ambition and no morals l wouldnt bet against you
littlefinger	And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
varys	l must be one of the few men in this city who doesnt want to be King

varys	Oh, you can do better than that
littlefinger	When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? lve always wondered
varys	Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering whats between my legs?
littlefinger	l picture a gash Like a womans ls that about right?
varys	l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all
littlefinger	Must be strange for you, even after all these years a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all
varys	Am l? That is good to know Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
littlefinger	But you carry on whispering in one kings ear and then the next l admire you
varys	And l admire you, Lord Baelish A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women
littlefinger	A useful talent, lm sure youd agree
varys	So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect

joffrey	What kind of stupid peasants superstition.
sandor	The girl is right What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year
joffrey	Take him away Ill have him killed tomorrow, the fool

tyrion	Beloved nephew
tyrion	We looked for you on the battlefield You were nowhere to be found
joffrey	Ive been here, ruling the kingdoms
tyrion	What a fine job youve done Look at you More beautiful than ever And you! You, youre going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking This one doesnt like me
bronn	Cant imagine why
joffrey	We heard you were dead
myrcella	Im glad youre not dead
tyrion	Me, too, dear Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world My Lady, Im sorry for your loss
joffrey	Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor
tyrion	But still her father Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize
sansa	My father was a traitor My mother and brother are traitors, too I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey
tyrion	Of course you are
tyrion	Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done
joffrey	What work? Why are you here?
pycelle	The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last The longest summer in living memory
varys	The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter
pycelle	A common superstition
littlefinger	We have enough wheat for a five-year winter If it lasts any longer, , well have fewer peasants
janos	The citys drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, itll only get worse
cersei	You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?
janos	I do, Your Grace
cersei	And are you not a Lord at my command?
janos	I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace
cersei	Then do your job Shut the gates to the peasants They belong in the field, not our capital
janos	Yes, Your Grace
tyrion	Dont get up More ravishing than ever, big sister War agrees with you Forgive the interruption, carry on
cersei	What are you doing here?
tyrion	Its been a remarkable journey I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell I fought with the hill tribes So many adventures, so much to be thankful for
cersei	What are you doing here? This is the small council
tyrion	Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings
cersei	Our father is Hand of the King
tyrion	Yes, but in his absence
varys	Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights
cersei	Out! All of you out I would like to know how you tricked father into this
tyrion	If I were capable of tricking father, Id be emperor of the world by now You brought this on yourself
cersei	Ive done nothing
tyrion	Quite right You did nothing when your son called for Ned Starks head Now the entire North has risen up against us
cersei	I tried to stop it
tyrion	Did you? You failed That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation
cersei	Robb Stark is a child
tyrion	Whos won every battle hes fought Do you understand were losing the war?
cersei	What do you know about warfare?
tyrion	Nothing But I know people And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us
cersei	Joffrey is King
tyrion	Joffrey is King
cersei	You are here to advise him
tyrion	Im only here to advise him And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back
cersei	How?
tyrion	You love your children Its your one redeeming quality That and your cheekbones The Starks love their children as well And we have two of them
cersei	One
tyrion	One?
cersei	Arya, little animal, she disappeared
tyrion	Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade You chopped ones head off and let another escape Father will be furious It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child
lord	My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
lord	The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and Im afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers hammers When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhens Square in a summer Men worked back then Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps And the Gods forbid it rains Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall
luwin	Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast
lord	Generally, yes, but Ive sent all the young men off to fight Robb Starks war
bran	King Robb And its not his war He didnt choose it
lord	Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men
bran	Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord Do you remember your vows, Ser?
lord	Of course I remember
luwin	We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?
lord	I I believe it will
luwin	We didnt want him here all day, did we?
bran	I didnt like the way he was talking about Robb
luwin	Nor did I But listening to people youd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell Lord Portan
portan	My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
osha	Boil this for an hour and drink the tea Makes all your pain go away
bran	Dont have any pain
osha	Lucky for you
bran	That way
osha	Youve been having those dreams again
bran	I dont dream
osha	Everyone dreams
bran	I dont Heard some of the men talking about the comet They say its an omen They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South
osha	Did they? I heard some other fools say its Lannister Red Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long I heard a stable boy say its the color of blood, to mark the death of your father
osha	The stars dont fall for men The red comet means one thing, boy Dragons
bran	The dragons are all dead Theyve been dead for centuries
doreah	What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?
daenerys	He said they ate meat
doreah	He didnt tell you what kind of meat?
daenerys	My brother didnt know anything about dragons He didnt know anything about anything
daenerys	She was Drogos first gift to me
jorah	I remember
daenerys	I promised to protect them Promised them their enemies would die screaming How do I make starvation scream?
jorah	A trick I never learned, Im afraid
daenerys	Does it ever end?
jorah	This is further east than Ive ever been But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste
daenerys	And youre sure theres no other way?
jorah	If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons
daenerys	No one will take my dragons
jorah	They are too weak to fight, as are your people You must be their strength
daenerys	As you are mine
daenerys	Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro Take our remaining horses You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast
rakharo	What do we seek, Khaleesi?
daenerys	Cities, living or dead Caravans and people Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side
daenerys	Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood
rakharo	I will not fail you, blood of my blood
daenerys	You never have
rakharo	This is bad time to start
jon	Having a rough time of it?
sam	Nothings killed me yet
grenn	Your ass killed the sledge
sam	You offered me a ride
grenn	I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters

men	ing in the North
roose	Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours Theyre dead Take everything theyve got Weve nowhere to keep all these prisoners Barely enough food to feed our own
robb	Were not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton
roose	Of course, Your Grace The officers will be useful Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannisters plans
robb	I doubt it
roose	Well, well learn soon enough In my family, we say, A naked man has few secrets A flayed man none
robb	My father outlawed flaying in the North
roose	Were not in the North
robb	Were not torturing them
roose	The high roads very pretty, but youll have a hard time marching your army down it
robb	The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own I wont give them an excuse to abuse my sisters
wounded soldier	No, dont! Dont! Please
shhh talisa	The rots set in
wounded soldier	No, dont! No, dont
talisa	Shh
wounded soldier	Please, dont! Itll get better It doesnt even hurt
talisa	The rot will spread If we dont take the foot now WOUNDED
soldier	No, you cant
wounded soldier	Ser! Please, ser
i cant lose robb	Youll die if she doesnt
wounded soldier	I dont want to be a cripple, please
roose	Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub
talisa	Your men are not my men, my lord
robb	Put this in your mouth and lie down You dont want to watch

robb	Bite on it Its better than biting your own tongue, believe me
robb	Whats your name?
talisa	Talisa
robb	Your last name?
talisa	You want to know what side my family fights on?
robb	You know my family name You have me at a disadvantage
talisa	That boy lost his foot on your orders
robb	They killed my father
talisa	That boy did?
robb	The family he fights for
talisa	Do you think hes friends with King Joffrey? Hes a fishermans son that grew up near Lannisport He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago
robb	I have no hatred for the lad
talisa	That should help his foot grow back
robb	Youd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed I understand The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey
talisa	Youre going to kill Joffrey?
robb	If the gods give me strength
talisa	And then what?
robb	I dont know Well go back to Winterfell I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne
talisa	So who will?
robb	I dont know
talisa	Youre fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?
robb	First we have to win the war
robb	You never told me where youre from
talisa	Volantis
robb	Volantis? Youre far from home The boy was lucky you were here
talisa	He was unlucky that you were
joffrey	Youre here to answer for your brothers latest treasons
sansa	Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part You know that I beg you
please joffrey	Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage
lancel	Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves Thousands of good men were butchered After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain
joffrey	Killing you would send your brother a message
joffrey	But my mother insists on keeping you alive Stand So well have to send your brother a message some other way Meryn
joffrey	Leave her face I like her pretty
joffrey	Meryn, my lady is overdressed Unburden her
joffrey	If you want Robb Stark to hear us, were going to have to speak louder
tyrion	What is the meaning of this?
tyrion	What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
meryn	The kind who serves his king, Imp
bronn	Careful, now We dont want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak
tyrion	Someone get the girl something to cover herself with She is to be your queen Have you no regard for her honor?
joffrey	Im punishing her
tyrion	For what crimes? She did not fight her brothers battle, you half-wit
joffrey	You cant talk to me like that The king can do as he likes
tyrion	The Mad King did as he liked Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
meryn	No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard
tyrion	Im not threatening the king, ser I am educating my nephew Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him That was a threat See the difference?
tyrion	I apologize for my nephews behavior Tell me the truth Do you want an end to this engagement?
sansa	I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love
tyrion	Lady Stark, you may survive us yet
bronn	The little kings backed up Clogged from balls to brains
tyrion	You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
bronn	Theres no cure for being a cunt But the boys at that age And hes got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies Couldnt hurt to get some of the poison out
joffrey	What are you doing here, dog?
sandor	Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it
joffrey	And? What is it?
sandor	Look inside, Your Grace
daisy	Your Grace
ros	Happy nameday, Your Grace
joffrey	My nameday has passed
ros	We wont tell if you wont
joffrey	No Her Touch her
joffrey	Could you hit her?
joffrey	My uncle sent you?
daisy	Yes, Your Grace He chose us himself
ros	Hmm
joffrey	Use this
joffrey	Harder
joffrey	I said harder Hed want me to get his moneys worth
ros	Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure
daisy	Please, Your Grace
ros	Your Grace, if your uncle finds out
joffrey	Oh, I want him to find out You will bring her to his chambers when youre finished and show him what youve done, or the same thing will happen to you
joffrey	Begin
joffrey	Harder
renly	Well, if it isnt my favorite whoremonger Pray I havent kept you waiting long
littlefinger	Your Grace
renly	Now you do the Lannisters bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brothers body even cold before you secured your newest patron?
littlefinger	Im a practical man
renly	Just not a loyal one
littlefinger	And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brothers corpse?
renly	I dont like you, Lord Baelish I dont like your face I dont like the words that come oozing out of your mouth I dont want you in my tent one minute more than necessary So tell me, why are you here?
renly	You can trust Brienne Her loyalty comes without charge
littlefinger	You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim
renly	Now I understand You know I have the numbers You know Im marching on Kings Landing When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position And your head
littlefinger	I would give priority to my head
littlefinger	I understand that you dont like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection When you march on Kings Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates
littlefinger	Your Grace
margaery	Lord Baelish
littlefinger	All of these tents look the same to me -Would you be so kind
margaery	It would be my pleasure It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress And the moment I learn which tent is mine, were on the move again
littlefinger	Your tent ? Not Our tent ? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt Four kings vying for the throne
margaery	I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers
littlefinger	If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world I did notice your brother entering His Graces tent just now
margaery	The place of a Kingsguard is by the kings side
littlefinger	And on the night of your wedding, who was by the kings side then?
margaery	You seem quite interested in our marriage
littlefinger	Your marriage is quite interesting Not only to me, but to the realm The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else
margaery	Youve never married, have you?
littlefinger	Ive been unlucky in my affections, sadly
margaery	That is sad Though perhaps its for the best The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain My husband is my king, and my king is my husband Here is your tent, Lord Baelish Good night
daenerys	This isnt your horse
kovarro	It was given to me by the Thirteen The Elders of Qarth
daenerys	Qarth?
kovarro	Three days to the east, on the sea
daenerys	Will they let us in?
kovarro	They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons
daenerys	What do you know of this place?
jorah	Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows
man	Go on
man	You, keep moving

catelyn	How dare you?
littlefinger	You may have heard false reports
catelyn	You betrayed Ned
littlefinger	Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm I begged him to seize the moment
catelyn	I trusted you My husband trusted you And you repaid our faith with treachery
littlefinger	No, my lady
catelyn	Get out
littlefinger	Cat, Ive Ive loved you since I was a boy It seems to me that fate has given us this chance
catelyn	Have you lost your mind? Get out
littlefinger	Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?
catelyn	You have Arya, too?
littlefinger	Both girls are healthy and safe For now But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital
catelyn	What do you want?
littlefinger	The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer
catelyn	Of course they will Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms
littlefinger	Im not bringing these terms to him Im bringing them to you
catelyn	You think I keep secrets from my son?
littlefinger	Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but hes not a mother Consider it, Cat You may not get another chance Ive brought you a gift
catelyn	I dont want your gifts A token of Tyrion Lannisters goodwill He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith
catelyn	Good faith?
catelyn	Whats this?
littlefinger	Your husband was an honorable man He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell You may not believe
catelyn	Get out
man	Get up, you dogs
hot pie	Thats him, the one who picks
arya	The Mountain What are you doing?

stannis	Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands
catelyn	I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis
renly	Can that truly be you?
stannis	Who else might it be?
renly	When I saw your standard, I couldnt be sure Whose banner is that?
stannis	My own
renly	I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing Why is your stag on fire?
melisandre	The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light
renly	Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age
stannis	Watch yourself, Renly
renly	No, no, Im relieved I never really believed you were a fanatic Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man
melisandre	You should kneel before your brother Hes the Lords chosen, born amidst salt and smoke
renly	Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
stannis	Thats twice Ive warned you
catelyn	Listen to yourselves If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers
stannis	It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark Your husband was a supporter of my claim Lord Eddards integrity cost him his head And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me
catelyn	We share a common enemy
stannis	The Iron Throne is mine by right All those that deny that are my foes
renly	The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers wombs No one wants you for their king You never wanted any friends, brother But a man without friends is a man without power
stannis	For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council Ill even name you my heir until a son is born to me Otherwise I shall destroy you
renly	Look across those fields, brother Can you see all those banners?
stannis	You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
renly	No The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king
stannis	We shall see, Renly Come the dawn, we shall see
melisandre	Look to your sins, Lord Renly The night is dark and full of terrors
renly	Would you believe I loved him once?
daenerys	I thought we were welcome
jorah	If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi
daenerys	Horde?
daenerys	My name is Daenerys SPICE
king	Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen
daenerys	You know me, my lord?
spice king	Only by reputation, Khaleesi And Im no lord, merely a humble merchant They call you the Mother of Dragons
daenerys	And what should I call you?
spice king	Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce I am simply a trader of spices But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be
daenerys	The beauty of Quarth is legendary SPICE KING Qarth
daenerys	Qarth
spice king	Might we see the dragons?
daenerys	My friend, we have traveled very far We have no food, no water Once I see my people fed, I would be honored SPICE
king	Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves
daenerys	I am not a liar
spice king	Oh, I dont think you are But as Ive never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value
daenerys	Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates
spice king	Then perhaps you should return to where you come from We wish you well
daenerys	What are you doing? You promised to receive me
spice king	We have received you Here we are, and here you are
daenerys	If you do not let us in, all of us will die
spice king	Which we shall deeply regret But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates
jorah	Khaleesi, please be careful
daenerys	Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground Turn us away and we will burn you first
spice king	Ah You are a true Targaryen Only, as you said a moment ago, if we dont let you into the city, you will all die
and so xaro	Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be
spice king	The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos The Thirteen have spoken
xaro	I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking
spice king	The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons
xaro	Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still SPICE
king	Our decision is final
xaro	Very well I invoke soumai
xaro	I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law
spice king	Be it on your head
xaro	Welcome to Qarth, my lady
mountain	You
tickler	Is there gold or silver in the village?
gendry	Im not from the village
tickler	Where is the Brotherhood?

mountain	Cells are overflowing, my lord
polliver	This lot wont be here long Dont need no permanent place After we interrogate em

mountain	My lord
tyrion	Your visits are too few, cousin
lancel	Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle Heres your warrant
tyrion	So it is Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep
lancel	I am here at Her Graces behest, not to drink with you, Imp
tyrion	If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought shed come herself Instead she sends you What am I to make of that?
lancel	I dont care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately
tyrion	And youve received these instructions directly from Cersei?
lancel	As I said several times
tyrion	And youve waited this long to deliver the information?
lancel	When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay
tyrion	Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf
lancel	The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities She often works from dusk till dawn
tyrion	She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn
tyrion	Ah Lavender oil She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl
lancel	I am a knight
tyrion	An anointed knight, yes Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?
lancel	You will withdraw these filthy accusations
tyrion	Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out youve been bedding his mother?
lancel	Its not my fault
tyrion	Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?
lancel	Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the Kings squire, he told me to obey her in everything
tyrion	Did he tell you to fuck her, too?
lancel	I only meant I did as I was bid
tyrion	Hated every moment of it, is that what youll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sisters legs spreading open for you at night Oh, yes, it must have been terrible Wait here His Grace will want to hear this
lancel	Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you
tyrion	Save it for Joffrey He loves a good grovel
lancel	My lord, it was your sisters bidding, the Queen Ill leave the city at once, I swear
tyrion	No, I think not
lancel	My lord?
tyrion	You heard me My father told you to obey my sister Obey her Stay close to her side Keep her trust Pleasure her whenever she requires No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything And you will tell me
lancel	Yes, my lord, I will I swear it, as you command
tyrion	Oh, rise, rise Let us drink to our understanding Oh, you dont have a cup Oh, well Smile, cousin My sister is a beautiful woman, and its all for the good of the realm Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent
lancel	But her demands?
tyrion	Oh, Ill give her Pycelle
lancel	You will?
tyrion	Yes, Ill release him in the morning Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true Stay within one table length
davos	Your Grace
stannis	Do your knucklebones bring you luck?
davos	Well, lifes been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace And its four less fingernails to clean
stannis	Fewer
davos	Pardon?
stannis	Four fewer fingernails to clean Never understood why you had to wear them
davos	It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now It reminds me of your justice It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver
stannis	You were a hero and a smuggler A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good
davos	A lesson Ive tried to teach my son
stannis	Does he listen?
davos	To me? Gods, no But if your red woman told him to leap from the crows nest
stannis	She has a name I trust youve not forgotten your smugglers tricks
davos	Ive lived within the law for 17
stannis	I want you to be a smuggler this time
davos	Any shore, any night What am I bringing ashore?
stannis	The red woman No one must know what you do and well not speak of this again
davos	I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways
stannis	Cleaner ways dont win wars
melisandre	Are you afraid, Onion Knight?
davos	Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors
melisandre	Youve carried more unpleasant cargo in your time Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?
davos	Id say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad
melisandre	If half an onion is black with rot, its a rotten onion A man is good or he is evil
davos	And which are you?
melisandre	Oh, good Im a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life
davos	Well, that must be very nice for you
melisandre	Do you love your wife?
davos	I do
melisandre	Yet you have known other women
davos	Dont talk about my wife
melisandre	Im not Im talking about other women Like me, Ser Davos You want me You want to see whats beneath this robe
melisandre	And you will
davos	Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows
melisandre	Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos They are servants of light, the children of fire And the brighter the flame, the darker they are
davos	These werent here before Theyve barred the passage
melisandre	They cant bar our passage
davos	Gods protect us
renly	You swear it?
catelyn	By the mother My son has no interest in the Iron Throne
renly	Then I see no reason for hostility between us Your soncan go on calling himself King in the North The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty
catelyn	And the wording of this oath?
renly	The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together
catelyn	And in return for my sons loyalty?
renly	In the morning, Ill destroy my brothers army
renly	When thats done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before
catelyn	Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle Negotiate a peace with your brother
renly	Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there Id have better luck debating the wind
renly	Please bring my terms to your son I believe we are natural allies I hope he feels the same Together we could end this war in a fortnight
brienne	No! No
soldier	Follow me
soldier	Youll die for this
catelyn	No, wait, it wasnt her
catelyn	Weve got to leave Theyll hang you for this
man	Inside the kings tent
go man	Now
brienne	I wont leave him
catelyn	You cant avenge him if youre dead
man	Over there, go
brienne	Not that way
margaery	We need to go home Loras
littlefinger	My lord, my lady
loras	Get out
littlefinger	Stannis will be here in an hour When he arrives, Renlys bannermen will flock to him Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king
loras	And you want that privilege for yourself
littlefinger	You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis
margaery	Theres no time for this
loras	Ride back to Highgarden, sister Im not running from Stannis
margaery	Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly
loras	I dont believe that You dont believe that Who gained the most from our kings death?
littlefinger	Stannis
loras	I will put a sword through his righteous face
margaery	You cant stay here
loras	He would have been a true king, a good king
littlefinger	Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?
loras	Revenge
littlefinger	I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you wont have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today Youll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground If it is justice that you want, be smart about it
margaery	You cant avenge him from the grave Bring the horses Please
margaery	He was very handsome
littlefinger	He was, Your Grace
margaery	Your Grace Calling yourself king doesnt make you one And if Renly wasnt a king, I wasnt a queen
littlefinger	Do you want to be a queen?
margaery	No I want to be the queen
cersei	Killed? By whom?
tyrion	Accounts differ Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way
cersei	Really? Whod have thought?
tyrion	Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour
cersei	Whomever did it, I say well done
tyrion	Its not what Varys says He says Renlys army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea
cersei	Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one
tyrion	And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later
cersei	Arent there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?
tyrion	Shell be safer in Dorne
cersei	Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety
tyrion	It so happens that I am Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I dont blame her at all for you
cersei	So clever Arent you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
tyrion	Schemes and plots are the same thing They are going to attack us We need to be ready
cersei	No need to concern yourself over it The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations
tyrion	May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
cersei	You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely The answer will be the same
tyrion	Its important that we talk about this
cersei	Its the kings royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors
lancel	Its wildfire
tyrion	Wildfire? You wouldnt lie to me, would you, cousin?
lancel	No
tyrion	Thats a lie right there
lancel	It is not a lie Why would I lie?
tyrion	Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him youre fucking her, I mean
lancel	Im telling you the truth
tyrion	The smart money would be on more likely
lancel	Shes making wildfire
tyrion	But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours
lancel	The Alchemists Guild is being commissioned
tyrion	I suppose theres only one way to find out
lancel	They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis ships and armies Please
tyrion	When did she tell you this?
lancel	I heard her talking with the pyromancer And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him I swear to you
tyrion	Swear to me on what?
lancel	On my life
tyrion	But I dont care about your life
lancel	In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow
tyrion	All right, all right Enough Even torturing you is boring Just get out
tyrion	Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me
lancel	Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion
bronn	It will be my pleasure
davos	Your Grace
stannis	What is it?
davos	Im sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him
stannis	Fools love a fool I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be
davos	I need to speak to you about what I saw in that cave
stannis	I thought I made it clear to you thered be no need to speak to me on this matter
davos	Your Grace, I -
stannis	Ive never known you to need to hear a thing twice
davos	And Ive never known you to hide from the truth
stannis	Youve come to lecture me on truth?
davos	Ive come to tell you that what I saw
stannis	All my brothers bannermen have come to my side Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards They wont be able to resist us now Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne
davos	Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron
stannis	Ill hear no more about it
man	Take a company of men, secure the perimeter
davos	When do we sail for Kings Landing?
stannis	As soon as Ive consolidated my troops Well make short work of the Lannisters fleet Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, well deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city
davos	And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
stannis	Thats not your concern
davos	If you take Kings Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers
stannis	I never thought Id have reason to doubt your loyalty Was I wrong?
davos	Loyal service means telling hard truths
stannis	Oh, truth again All right, whats the truth? The hard truth?
davos	Shes a foreigner preaching her foreign religion Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey
stannis	What do you believe?
davos	You won those bannermen from Renly Dont lose them to her
stannis	We set out for Kings Landing without Lady Melisandre And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay
davos	Your Grace, Im honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them The other lords wont be happy
stannis	Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I dont hang them for treason Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos
girl	Ive got it! Ive got it
man	So its that one there at the top, on the right
man	Buy my fruit, my lord Fresh fruit
tyrion	Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses What do we have?
bronn	Theres that mind of yours you keep going on about
tyrion	Well, Ive never actually been able to kill people with it
bronn	Good thing Id be out of a job What about your father?
tyrion	He hasnt sent a raven in weeks Hes very busy Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming We wont be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffreys planning on holding it
protester	Corruption
crowd	Yes
protester	We are swollen, bloated, foul Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and were surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king
tyrion	Its hard to argue with his assessment
bronn	Not after what he did to your birthday present
tyrion	The king is a lost cause Its the rest of us Im worried about now
man	A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey
tyrion	You have to admire his imagination
bronn	Hes talking about you
tyrion	What? Demon monkey?
bronn	People think youre pulling the kings strings They blame you for the citys ills
tyrion	Blame me? Im trying to save them
bronn	You dont need to convince me
tyrion	Demon monkey
man	Yeah, come on
theon	Youre the crew of the Sea Bitch? Im your commander Welcome
theon	Stop Stop! Your captain commands you to stop
black lorren	Where are we headed, Captain?
theon	The Stony Shore, to raid their villages Therell be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well
black lorren	And who decides if weve done our jobs well?
theon	I do Your captain
black lorren	I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balons balls, Captain Dont reckon Ive got much use for your ideas on how to do it Dont reckon Ive got much use for a captain at all Im thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself All I need is a ship You wouldnt know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?
theon	You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor
yara	Stop We yield
yara	Congratulations on your first command
theon	Thank you Kind of you to come see me off
yara	Oh, Im not here for you I was just on my way to Red Harbor Ive got 30 ships Theres nowhere to put them here Too narrow
theon	Youd better get out there Wouldnt want her to set sail without you
yara	That would never happen My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to This lot, though Enjoy the Stony Shore
dagmer	Come on, Ill take you out
theon	Who are you?
dagmer	Dagmer, your first mate
theon	Why arent you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh
dagmer	Theyre not gonna respect you until you prove yourself
theon	And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
dagmer	Youre not
theon	And yet thats the task my father has given me to prove that Im a true Iron Islander
dagmer	Theyre all Iron Islanders Do they do as theyre told or do they do as they like?
theon	The Stony Shores not far from Torrhens Square
dagmer	The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermens daughters What, you dont think we could take it?
theon	No, we could We could never hold it for more than a few days As soon as Winterfell got word that wed taken Torrhens Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back
and then theon	Take me to my ship
reginald	The Starks have overextended their lines Now that summers over, theyll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed
tywin	The Starks understand winter better than we ever will The cold wont beat them
amory	Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn
tywin	And Im sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords This is war, no ones content Weve underestimated the Stark boy for too long He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him And as long as he keeps winning battles, theyll keep believing he is King in the North Youve been waiting for him to fail He is not going to fail, not without our help So how do we stop him?
reginald	Weve worked through the night, my lord Perhaps wed profit from some sleep
tywin	Yes, I think you would, Reginald And because youre my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep Go, Im sure your wife must miss you
reginald	My wifes in Lannisport
tywin	Well, then youd better start riding Go, before I change my mind and send her your head
tywin	If your name wasnt Lannister, youd be scrubbing out pots in the cooks tent Go
tywin	Not wine, water Well be here for some time Girl, where are you from?
arya	Maidenpool, my lord
tywin	And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me
arya	House Mooton, my lord
tywin	And what is their sigil?
tywin	A red salmon I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that Youre a Northerner, arent you?
tywin	Good One more time, where are you from?
arya	Barrowton, my lord House Dustin Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown
tywin	And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
arya	They call him the Young Wolf
tywin	And?
arya	They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants They say he cant be killed
tywin	And do you believe them?
arya	No, my lord Anyone can be killed
tywin	Fetch that water
jaqen	A girl says nothing
jaqen	A girl keeps her mouth closed No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl
arya	I was always a girl
jaqen	And I was always aware But the girl keeps secrets It is not for a man to spoil them
arya	Youre one of them now I should have let you burn
jaqen	And you fetch water for one of them now Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
arya	I didnt have a choice
jaqen	You did I did And here we are
jaqen	A man pays his debts A man owes three
arya	Three what?
jaqen	The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl And only death may pay for life You saved me and the two I was with You stole three deaths from the Red God We have to give them back Speak three names and the man will do the rest Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and were done
arya	I can name anyone and youll kill him?
jaqen	A man has said
arya	The one who tortures everyone
jaqen	A man needs a name
arya	I dont know his name They call him the Tickler
jaqen	That is enough Go now, girl Your master is thirsty
jeor	Hes not here yet Hed have seen us, blown the horn
jon	When will he come?
jeor	The Halfhand does things in his own time
jon	My uncle told me stories about him
jeor	Most of them are true
jon	I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall
jeor	The whole winter He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came Had to wait for the thaw
jon	So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own
jeor	Well, possible for the Halfhand
sam	Beautiful, isnt it? Gilly would love it here
eddison tollett	Theres nothing more sickening than a man in love
man	About time you did something At least youll keep warm
sam	The Fist of the First Men Think of how old this place is Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men
eddison tollett	Before I die, please, stop talking
sam	Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where were standing all through the long night What do you think they were like, the First Men?
eddison tollett	Stupid Smart people dont find themselves in places like this
jon	I think they were afraid I think they came here to get away from something And I dont think it worked
grenn	Wildlings?
jon	One blast is for rangers returning Wildlings is two blasts
eddison tollett	So you got to stand there waiting, wondering One blast for friends, two for foes
sam	And three for White Walkers Its been a thousand years, but thats the only time they blow the horn three times
grenn	But if its been a thousand years, how do you know?
sam	Well I read it in a book
eddison tollett	I read it in a book
jon	Look Its Qhorin Halfhand
eddison tollett	Aye, well live another day Hurrah
haylene	Take care, my lord
tyrion	I remember reading an old sailors proverb, Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off
haylene	Oh, I have not conducted this experiment It could well be true The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow
haylene	After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power
tyrion	My companion takes issue
bronn	If I could tell you how many crazy old men Ive seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit No offense meant
haylene	Our order does not deal in pig shit The substance is fire given form And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor
bronn	To do what?
haylene	The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy
tyrion	How much do you have?
bronn	If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe youd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father
haylene	My lord, this man is insulting
bronn	I dont know if youve ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy Cause when were flinging things at Stannis, hes flinging them right back at us Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down
tyrion	My friend remains unconvinced
haylene	He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived
bronn	Well, hes not living anymore And all his pots of wildfire didnt help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks
haylene	We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so Our present count stands at 7,811 Enough to burn Stannis Baratheons fleet and armies both
bronn	This is a shit idea
tyrion	Im afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene The contents of this room could lay Kings Landing low You wont be making wildfire for my sister any longer Youll be making it for me
daenerys	Dracarys Dracarys
daenerys	Hell be able to feed himself from now on
daenerys	Let him sleep, Doreah
doreah	Yes, Khaleesi
daenerys	He loves you
irri	I rewove this part of the top And I fixed the heel on this one
daenerys	Thank you, my friend
doreah	Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say hes the wealthiest man in Qarth
irri	It is known
doreah	And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos
daenerys	The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo
irri	May he ride forever through the night lands
daenerys	Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him Men like to talk about other men when theyre happy
doreah	You would look like a real princess in Xaros
irri	Shes not a princess Shes a Khaleesi You should wear it, Khaleesi
irri	You are their guest It would be rude not to
woman	And you must visit the night market The Qartheen night market is like no night market youve ever seen
daenerys	It sounds wonderful
woman	The Meereenis think they have a night market I will take you there myself
daenerys	Please excuse me for a moment
daenerys	What are they doing?
jorah	Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold Very soft He can chop off as much as we can carry
kovarro	Or melt it Very simple
daenerys	We are his guests! You cant pry it or chop it or melt it
kovarro	Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave
daenerys	Not even when we leave
kovarro	Why not?
daenerys	Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more
daenerys	My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built
jorah	Its not the only thing Theyre quite good at killing the better men
daenerys	Thats not the kind of queen Im going to be
pyatt pree	Mother of Dragons On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you A demonstration?
pyatt pree	Take this gem Look at it Into its depths So many facets Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them Often more than once
pyatt pree	Should you grow tired of Xaros baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons
xaro	My apologies Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen It was customary for me to extend him an invitation Customs die slow deaths in Qarth
daenerys	What is the House of the Undying?
xaro	It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening It turns their lips blue and their minds soft So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic
quaithe	You watch over her
jorah	Do I know you?
quaithe	I know you Jorah Mormont of Bear Island
jorah	Who are you?
quaithe	Im no one But she is the Mother of Dragons She needs true protectors, now more than ever They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh And fire is power
brienne	It looked like Stannis
catelyn	To me it just looked like A shadow in the shape of a man
brienne	In the shape of Stannis
catelyn	We should reach my sons camp tomorrow
brienne	Will you stay there long, my lady?
catelyn	Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen After that, I will leave for Winterfell My two youngest need me Ive been away from them for far too long
brienne	I never knew my mother
catelyn	Im sorry
catelyn	My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young
brienne	Its a bloody business
catelyn	What comes after is even harder
brienne	Once youre safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?
catelyn	You mean to kill Stannis
brienne	I swore a vow
catelyn	But Stannis has a great army around him His own guards are sworn to keep him safe
catelyn	Im as good as any of them I should never have fled
catelyn	Renlys death was no fault of yours You served him bravely
brienne	I only held him that once as he was dying
catelyn	Hes gone, Brienne You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth Renlys enemies are Robbs enemies as well
brienne	I do not know your son, my lady But I could serve you, if you would have me You have courage Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I dont know, a womans kind of courage And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis

rodrik	Bran! Lord Stark Torrhens Square is under siege
luwin	Torrhens Square is barely 40 leagues from here How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
rodrik	Might be a raiding party led by the mountain Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister
bran	We have to help them
rodrik	Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather 200 decent men
luwin	Do you need so many?
bran	If we cant protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik Take the men you need
rodrik	Wont take long, my lord Southerners dont do well up here
bran	So, what does it mean?
osha	Ask your Maester Luwin Hes the one studying books all the time
bran	I did ask him Hed never heard of a three-eyed raven
osha	Must not mean anything, then
bran	Youre lying
osha	You might be a little lord, but dont you call me a liar
bran	You know what it means
osha	I never said I didnt
bran	You didnt give me an honest answer
osha	Thats not the same as being a liar
bran	Well, its not far off
osha	So, youve been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didnt dream Now whos a liar? What did you see in your dream?
osha	Something bad? Tell me, boy
bran	I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls It flooded the castle Drowned men were floating here, in the yard Ser Rodrik was one of them
osha	The sea is hundreds of miles away
bran	I know Its just a stupid dream
osha	Ive got to get these potatoes to the kitchen Otherwise theyll put me in chains again
bran	Osha The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?
osha	They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall
qhorin	There
jeor	Where?
qhorin	On that mountain
sam	I dont see very well
jon	A fire
qhorin	Theres a fire The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor
jeor	How many wildlings have joined him?
qhorin	From what we can tell, all of them Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves Theyre almost ready to make their move
jon	Where?
qhorin	Somewhere safe Somewhere south Cant just march into their midst And we cant wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us
jeor	You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
qhorin	Mance was one of us once Now hes one of them Hes going to teach them our way of doing things Theyll hit us in force and they wont run away when we hit back Theyre gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us So we need to be more like them, do things their way Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall And to do that
jeor	We need to get rid of those lookouts
qhorin	Its not a job for 400 men I need to move fast and silent Harker, Stonesnake, Borba
jon	Lord Commander, Id like to join Lord Qhorin
qhorin	Ive been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin Youre a steward, Snow, not a ranger
jon	Ive fought and killed a wight How many rangers can say that?
qhorin	Hes the one?
jeor	Aye You killed a wight You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword
qhorin	Craster? In the boys defense, thats a tough old goat
sam	I could take up Jons duties while hes gone, my lord It would be no trouble
jeor	Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward Go on
xaro	So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?
daenerys	Hes not my manservant and hes not in love with me Hes my advisor and hes my friend
xaro	Unlikely I can almost always tell what a man wants
daenerys	And what about what a woman wants?
xaro	Much more complicated You, for example, what do you want?
daenerys	To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne
xaro	Why?
daenerys	Because I promised my khalasar Id protect them and find them a safe home
xaro	You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
daenerys	I want them because theyre mine by right The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it
xaro	Ah, a conqueror
daenerys	And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
xaro	No I come from nothing I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo
daenerys	So you wanted more than you had and you took it Youre a conqueror, too Youre just less ambitious
daenerys	What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me Why?
xaro	I will show you why
xaro	The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone The hardest steel does not make a mark I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it I made the same offer to the greatest thieves They all went home empty-handed The only thing that can open this door is this key
daenerys	And behind the door?
daenerys	And it can all be mine?
xaro	All? Let us say half More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies Enough to go home
daenerys	All I have to do?
xaro	Is marry me
daenerys	That was a romantic proposal
xaro	Ive already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me I come from nothing My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses
xaro	See? I have more ambition than you thought The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name Robert Baratheon is dead
jorah	If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it
daenerys	The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another Four false kings destroying the country
jorah	To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros
daenerys	The usurper is dead
daenerys	The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other
jorah	According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
daenerys	The time to strike is now We need to find ships and an army or well spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world
jorah	Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get Theyll give you ships and soldiers and theyll own you forever Moving carefully is the hard way, but its the right way
daenerys	And if Id listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, wed all be dead by now
jorah	I know the opportunity before you seems like the last youll ever have,
daenerys	Do not speak to me like Im a child
jorah	I only want
daenerys	What do you want? Tell me
jorah	To see you on the Iron Throne
daenerys	Why?
jorah	You have a good claim A title A birthright But you have something more than that You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved Someone who can rule and should rule Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world There are times when I look at you and I still cant believe youre real
daenerys	So what would you have me do, as my advisor?
jorah	Make your own way Find your own ship You only need one The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth
daenerys	And how do I get the ship?
jorah	Ill find it for you A sound ship with a good captain
daenerys	I look forward to meeting him
jorah	Khaleesi
arya	You should stand sideface

osha	You were here the day I was taken
theon	Im the one who took you What of it?
osha	Let me serve you
theon	Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts
osha	It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens Put a spear in my hand again
theon	So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up
osha	Step aside
bran	Why?
osha	Its your dream, little lord The ocean has come to swallow this place I aint letting it drown me
theon	Youll all go about your tasks as usual And in a few days time BLACK

theon	Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes
rodrik	It grieves me youve less honor than a back alley whore You were raised here under this roof These people are your people
theon	They are not my people
rodrik	King Robb thought of you as a brother
theon	My brothers are dead They died fighting Stark men, men like you
rodrik	Aye, they died fighting a war your father started Lord Stark raised you among his own sons
theon	Among them, but not one of them I was his hostage, taken from my home
rodrik	If he were alive to see this
theon	Hes not Hes dead The Seven Kingdoms are at war And Winterfell is mine
rodrik	I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand
theon	Youve served this house faithfully, old man But keep talking and Ill
theon	Take him to the cells
lock him up dagmer	My prince You cannot let that stand He must pay
theon	Ill lock him in a cell until he rots
dagmer	No, he has to pay the iron price Theyll never respect you while he lives
theon	Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death
bran	No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded
theon	The old man couldnt keep his mouth shut
luwin	I urge you not to make a hasty decision
theon	He disrespected me in front of my men That was his decision, not mine
luwin	He is worth more to you alive than dead The Starks will pay Please, Theon, think what you do
theon	Youll address me as Prince Theon or youll be next
dagmer	Come

qhorin	There goes your pet
jon	Hes not a pet
qhorin	No, youre right, hes not You cant tame a wild thing You cant trust a wild thing
jon	Ghost is different
qhorin	So you think Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons And youll never know them Now the wildlings were looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night
jon	I thought you said you couldnt know wild things
qhorin	I said you cant They find a nice cave to hide in while the suns up and do their killing when its dark
jon	We could do the same
qhorin	No, we couldnt This is their country They know where to walk, where not to walk Ive lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didnt see till they were in it
jon	My father always said Im of the North
jon	I wasnt joking
qhorin	Look around, boy This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you You understand me?
qhorin	No, you dont Were at war Weve always been at war Its never going to end cause were not fighting an enemy Were fighting the North, and its not going anywhere The Watch has given you a great gift You only have one thing to give in return, your life

jon	I do
qhorin	Youre even dumber than you look Its just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night Make us feel like weve got a purpose Come on Weve got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us

amory	My apologies, my lord
tywin	Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses Its the one on this
tywin	My cupbearer can read better than you
tywin	To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
armory	My lord
tywin	To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants I see I overestimated you If you ever put my sons life at risk again, Ill Leave us
tywin	Put the book away, girl Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while youre about it

littlefinger	Thank you
tywin	What news from the capital?
littlefinger	I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheons camp
tywin	Ah, the late King Renly Rather a short reign Murdered by a woman, I hear
littlefinger	So they say There has been talk of other forces at work Dark forces
tywin	Here Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel
littlefinger	It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after
tywin	You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it Yes, a crisis is an opportunity What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?
littlefinger	After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers
tywin	Yes, yes, yes
littlefinger	The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings Loras wants revenge He blames Stannis for Renlys death
tywin	Wants to be queen
littlefinger	Yes, she does
tywin	House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne Against my grandson
littlefinger	They did And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated
tywin	More wine for Lord Baelish
littlefinger	If you will allow me to represent your familys interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement
tywin	The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?
littlefinger	They have
arya	Pardon, my lord
littlefinger	Its only wine
tywin	You would ride there yourself?
littlefinger	Tonight, with your leave
tywin	Ill have an answer by nightfall Thatll be all, girl

sandor	I didnt do it for you
daenerys	He shouldnt make me wait
xaro	The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth He makes everyone wait Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth
daenerys	I already have a husband
xaro	Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful
daenerys	And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery
xaro	I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery
spice king	The Mother of Dragons
xaro	Ah, here he comes
spice king	Forgive me I had terrible dreams last night Terrible dreams I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you I am sorry about all that unpleasantness The silver hair of a true Targaryen Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself
xaro	Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself
spice king	Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? Ill have them flogged in the square
daenerys	Thank you, my lord You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want
spice king	Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one So, my little princess, what is it you want?
daenerys	My birthright The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros
spice king	I fear Im no better than a servant in this regard I cannot give you what I do not have
daenerys	Im not asking you for the kingdoms Im asking you for ships
spice king	I need to cross the Narrow Sea I need my ships as well I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another
daenerys	Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne
spice king	Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
daenerys	My father sat there, before he was murdered
spice king	But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say take the Iron Throne ?
daenerys	I didnt come here to argue grammar
spice king	Of course not You came to take my ships So let me explain my position, little princess Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors I make my living by trade And I judge every trade on its merits You ask for ships You say I shall be repaid triple I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms Do you have an army?
daenerys	Not yet
spice king	You do not have an army Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
daenerys	There are many there that support my claim
spice king	When were you there last?
daenerys	I left when I was a baby
spice king	So, in truth, you have no allies
daenerys	The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return
spice king	Ah Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams Now if youll pardon me
daenerys	Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, weve met
spice king	A shrewd man
daenerys	For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons
daenerys	Do you understand? Im no ordinary woman My dreams come true
spice king	I admire your passion But in business, I trust in logic, not passion Im sorry, little princess
daenerys	I am not your little princess I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine With fire and blood, I will take it
spice king	Yes, my lady, but not with my ships , catching her in the act
tywin	Who taught you to read?
arya	My father, my lord
tywin	Hmm I taught my son Jaime to read The maester came to me one day, told me he wasnt learning He couldnt make sense of the letters He reversed them in his head The maester said hed heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned He hated me for it, for a time For a long time But he learned Hmm Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?

robb	Lady Talisa
talisa	Your Grace
robb	Im not sure Im a lady
talisa	Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me
robb	Its hard to keep all the rules straight But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady Unless shes a queen or a princess I could find someone who knows
talisa	Why are you so sure Im of noble birth?
robb	Because its obvious
talisa	What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop?
robb	Id call you a liar
talisa	Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty
talisa	I always thought I was a brilliant liar
robb	Better at amputations, Im afraid
robb	Quite a pretty spot
talisa	Will we be here long?
robb	I couldnt really discuss troop movements with you
talisa	Im not a spy
robb	Of course, a spy would deny being a spy
talisa	Youre right Youve found me out Im writing a letter to the Lannisters The young wolf is on the move Perhaps youd join me If youve got time, of course, for
well catelyn	Robb
robb	Mother Mother, this is Lady Talisa Shes been helping with the wounded Shes been very helpful
catelyin	Lady Talisa
talisa	Lady Stark
catelyn	Lady Talisa
talisa	Maegyr
catelyn	Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name
talisa	An uncommon name here An old name in Volantis Excuse me, my lady Your Grace
robb	Ive missed you
catelyn	Yes, you look positively forlorn
robb	You surprised me, thats all I didnt think Id see you today
catelyn	I wish that you were free to follow your heart
robb	I know
catelyn	You have inherited your fathers responsibilities Im afraid they come at a cost You are promised to another
robb	I know
catelyn	A debt that must be paid
robb	I havent forgotten
roose	Your Grace My lady News from Winterfell
ygritte	Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go
jon	Well stop here Too dark to go any farther today
ygritte	Here? Theres no shelter here
jon	Theres no shelter anywhere
ygritte	There is if you know where to look The cold could kill us both If you light a fire
jon	No fire
ygritte	But a fire is
jon	No fire
ygritte	Have it your way
ygritte	Well stay warmer if we stay close
ygritte	Bet you freeze to death before I do Bet your life
ygritte	Think theyre out looking for you?
jon	Yes
ygritte	Think theyll find you?
jon	Yes
ygritte	Youre brave Stupid, but brave
jon	We start again at first light Get some sleep
jon	Stop moving
ygritte	Im just trying to get comfortable
jon	Stop it
jon	Youre still moving
ygritte	Was I? I didnt notice that time
robb	This cannot be true
roose	Weve had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort Im afraid it is true
robb	Why?
why would theon roose	Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores
robb	My brothers?
roose	Weve heard nothing of them But Rodrik Cassel is dead
catelyn	I told you, never trust a Greyjoy
robb	I must go north at once
roose	Theres still a war to win, Your Grace
robb	How can I call myself king if I cant hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I cant
roose	You are a king And that means you dont have to do everything yourself
catelyn	Let me go and talk to Theon
robb	There will be no talk He will die for this
roose	Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon We have the Lannisters on the run If you march all the way back north now, youll lose what you gained My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theons head
robb	Tell your son Bran and Rickons safety is paramount And Theon, I want him brought to me alive I want to look him in the eye and ask him why And then Ill take his head myself
theon	Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
osha	Im no liar
theon	All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone
osha	I done what I had to do to stay alive I hate the Starks as well as you do Let me serve you, my lord
theon	How? And dont tell me to put a spear in your hand
osha	There are other ways to serve, my lord
theon	Im a prince now, and youd do well
ahsa	There are other ways to serve, my prince
theon	Like what?
osha	We know things, the free people
theon	You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
osha	Other things
osha	Savage things
theon	Wait outside
theon	I always wondered what you had under there
osha	It comes at a price
theon	Im not killing you Thats your price
osha	I already had that
theon	What do you want then, other than your miserable life?
ahsa	What all free people want My freedom
theon	Well, you shall have it, then But only if you serve me well
sansa	Ow
shae	Shh Its not deep
sansa	I thought they were going to kill me
shae	They thought so, too
sansa	He hated me, the man who hit me I saw it in his eyes Hated me He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me
shae	Of course he did
sansa	Why? Why would a stranger
shae	You are everything he will never have Your horse eats better than his children It doesnt matter now Hes dead
sansa	I would have given them bread if I had it I hate the king more than any of them
shae	Dont say these things If the wrong people hear you
sansa	But youre not the wrong people
shae	Dont trust anybody Life is safer that way
guard	And where are you going?
osha	I have something for you from Prince Theon
guard	What?
osha	Me He says Im to make the rounds And keep you warm
daenerys	The Spice King refuses me because Im a bad investment The Silk King wont support me because of his business with the Lannisters Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
xaro	When I came to this city, I had nothing Truly nothing I slept by the docks And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat If not, I dreamed of food Today, I am the richest man in Qarth Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn And here I am, with no regrets
xaro	Bar the gates Ring the bells Slowly, Khaleesi
daenerys	W h e r e a r e t h e y ? W h e r e a r e m y d r a g o n s ?
theon	A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy cant walk, but somehow he slipped past you?
black lorren	The giant must have took him
theon	The giant? Hodor? Oh, thats all right, then You let a halfwit escape with a cripple And Rickon, too? The little one?
black lorren	Gone, along with the wildling woman The one you were fucking
theon	Right Get the horses and the hounds
man	Come on, find the scent Where they going?
dagmer	Halt
theon	Enjoying your first hunt?
luwin	So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord
theon	With hunting, theres blood at the end
luwin	Theyre little boys
theon	I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here So I kept my word I never ran away If I find them soon enough, I wont hurt them Well, Ill hurt them, but I wont kill them
luwin	Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead
theon	They have no value to me missing
luwin	Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now
theon	Robbs in the Riverlands My sisters in Deepwood Motte Shell get here long before they do And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000
man	We have a scent
theon	The hounds have the scent Come, Maester, dont look so grim Its all just a game
osha	We should have took more food
bran	We couldnt risk going to the kitchens
osha	Those people all love you They would have given you whatever you needed
bran	And if Theon found out, hed hang them
osha	The boy cant survive on walnuts
rickon	Im fine
osha	Weve been walking since before sunrise Eve will tire
hodor	Hodor
osha	Even you, sweet giant
hodor	Hodor
bran	Wait, I know that farm I sent those two Winterfell orphans there
rickon	Jack and Billy Theyll give us some food
bran	We cant risk it If Theon tracks us here, hell torture them until he finds out where we are
rikon	Billy climbs a tree better than anyone
osha	Youve never seen me climb a tree, little man
bran	Theyll be after us with hounds
osha	We got a good start on them, but we cant outrun hounds forever
ygritte	Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
ygritte	Whats the matter? Cant be the first time you pressed your bone against a womans arse
jon	Lets move
ygritte	It is the first time How old are you, boy?
jon	Im a man of the Nights Watch
ygritte	Youre a boy whos never been with a girl Dont your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets
jon	Dont call them that
ygritte	What, stones? Or bone?
jon	Neither Both
jon	Move
ygritte	I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you dont use them Of course, maybe thats just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them As if Id feel sorry for them Are there no girl crows?
jon	There are no women of the Nights Watch, no
ygritte	So the lads just do it with each other?
jon	No
ygritte	Never?
jon	Never We swore an oath
ygritte	You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder youre all so miserable
jon	Would you please shut up?
ygritte	Would you please shut up? You think youre better than me, crow Im a free woman
jon	Youre a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but Im a free woman
jon	If youre my prisoner, youre not a free woman Thats what prisoner means
ygritte	And you think youre free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl
jon	It was my choice to say the words
ygritte	So you dont like girls?
jon	Of course I like girls But you chose never to touch them
jon	Thats the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Nights Watch
ygritte	So instead of getting naked with a girl, youd prefer to invade our lands
jon	Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy
ygritte	Yheyre not your lands! Weve been here the whole time You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours
jon	My father was Ned Stark I have the blood of the First Men My ancestors lived here, same as yours
ygritte	So why are you fighting us?
man	Go on Now I want you to tell me what happened Come on, this way Come on, speak up Speak up
tywin	Wolfsbane A rare substance This is no common assassin
mountian	We hanged 20 men last night
tywin	I dont care if you hanged 100 A man tried to kill me I want his name and I want his head
mountain	We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners
tywin	Pretentious name for a band of outlaws We cant allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity We look like fools and they look like heroes Thats how kings fall I want them dead, every one
mountain	Killing them isnt the problem Its finding them Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence
twyin	Burn the villages, burn the farms Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side
tywin	Mmm Is that mutton?
arya	Yes, my lord
tywin	Dont like mutton
arya	Ill bring something else
tywin	Leave it Are you hungry?
arya	No
tywin	Of course you are Eat
arya	Ill eat in the kitchen later
tywin	Its bad manners to refuse a lords offer Sit Eat
tywin	Youre small for your age I suppose youve been underfed your whole life
arya	I eat a lot I just dont grow
tywin	Mmm This will be my last war Win or lose
arya	Have you ever lost before?
tywin	Do you think Id be in my position if I had lost a war?
tywin	But this is the one Ill be remembered for The War of Five Kings, theyre calling it My legacy will be determined in the coming months
tywin	Do you know what legacy means? Its what you pass down to your children and your childrens children Its what remains of you when youre gone Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy The greatest fortress ever built The tallest towers, the strongest walls The Great Hall had 35 hearths Thirty-five Can you imagine? Look at it now A blasted ruin Do you know what happened?
arya	Dragons?
tywin	Yes Dragons happened
tywin	Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmm-mmm Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls Aegon Targaryen changed the rules Thats why every child alive still knows his name
arya	Aegon and his sisters
tywin	Mmm?
arya	It wasnt just Aegon riding his dragon It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too
tywin	Correct A student of history, are you?
arya	Rhaenys rode Meraxes Visenya rode Vhagar
tywin	Im sure I knew that when I was a boy
arya	Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister
tywin	Hmm Shes a heroine of yours, I take it?
tywin	Arent most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
arya	Most girls are idiots
tywin	You remind me of my daughter Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
arya	From my father
tywin	He was a well-read stonemason Cant say Ive ever met a literate stonemason
arya	Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?
tywin	Careful now, girl I enjoy you, but be careful Take that back to the kitchen Eat what you want
tywin	And, girl
tywin	Mlord
tywin	Lowborn girls say mlord, not my lord If youre going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly
arya	My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord She taught me how to speak proper Properly
tywin	Youre too smart for your own good Has anyone told you that?
arya	Yes
tywin	Go on
sansa	I beg pardon, ser I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me You were so brave
sandor	Brave? A dog doesnt need courage to chase off rats
sansa	Does it give you joy to scare people?
sandor	No, it gives me joy to kill people
sandor	Spare me You cant tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man
sansa	It was his duty He never liked it
sandor	Is that what he told you? He lied Killing is the sweetest thing there is
sansa	Why are you always so hateful?
sandor	Youll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when youre queen and Im all that stands between you and your beloved king
xaro	Ive demanded a meeting of the Thirteen One of them did this or knows who did
daenerys	You are one of the Thirteen
xaro	If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them They mean nothing to me on their own
daenerys	Nothing? Theyre more valuable than anything in the world
xaro	Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back
daenerys	There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?
xaro	I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city A man is what others say he is and no more If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof
daenerys	But it did happen under your roof
xaro	Khaleesi, many times in my life
daenerys	I dont care where youve been
ygritte	You think were savages because we dont live in stone castles We cant make steel as good as yours, its true, but Were free If someone tried to tell us we couldnt lie down as man and woman, wed shove a spear up his arse We dont go serving some shit king whos only king because his father was
jon	No No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall
ygritte	We chose Mance Rayder to lead us He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free You could be free, too You dont need to live your whole life taking commands from old men Wake up when you want to wake up I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night
ygritte	Youre a pretty lad The girls would claw each others eyes out to get naked with you
jon	Walk
ygritte	I could teach you how to do it
jon	I know how to do it
ygritte	You know nothing, Jon Snow
robb	And what did she say?
alton	She admired your spirit, Your Grace
robb	And what then?
she robb	If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, wed all hang
alton	She tore the paper in half, Your Grace
robb	Youve acted with honor I thank you for it Lord Karstark, see that Ser Altons pen is clean, and give him a hot supper
rickard kar	Ser Altons pen is occupied, Your Grace The prisoners from the Yellow Fork
roose	Too many prisoners
robb	Is there room for Ser Alton?
rickard kar	Does he need to lie down?
robb	Have the men build him a new pen Put him in with the Kingslayer for now Have your boy watch over them
rickard kar	Torrhen
robb	That will be all
talisa	Your Grace A minute of your time?
talisa	Ive been treating your wounded men
robb	And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning
talisa	Theyre not my enemies
robb	Thats what I tell my bannermen
talisa	Ive already run through the supplies I brought with me Some are easily replaced Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses But some are not I need silk for stitching I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark Mostly I need milk of the poppy You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over
robb	If you need help finding these
talisa	I know where to find them Im sorry, I shouldnt interrupt you
robb	Continue, my lady
talisa	Youre riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
robb	Yes
talisa	The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need
robb	I expect he will
talisa	If I could write a list
robb	Come with me to the Crag
talisa	I dont think that will be
robb	Let the maester show you his stores I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men
woman	Children, come inside, quick Come on
child	Hurry up
man	Cant find anything, ser Theyve lost the scent
theon	Try again
man	Weve circled this farmhouse twice Theres no sign of them
luwin	We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord
theon	Im looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldnt do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again Ill beat them until they do Ill whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand And once Ive got them, the pampered little shits Its better to be cruel than weak
man	Prince Theon
theon	Where are they?
winterfell shepherd	Who, mlord?
theon	The Stark boys Where are they?
winterfell shepherd	I dont know I seen no one
theon	Think harder
winterfell shepherd	I swear, mlord I dont know
dagmer	My lord, over here I think Ive found what were looking for
dagmer	Send the old man home
theon	Go back to Winterfell Take him back
luwin	Theon, dont do this
daenerys	You came back
jorah	As soon as I heard Do you know anything?
daenerys	Irri is dead
jorah	I know She was a good
daenerys	Shes dead She died alone She died for me and I couldnt protect her
jorah	Doreah?
daenerys	We cant find her She must be dead, too I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse
jorah	I should have been here
daenerys	You went to find me a ship
jorah	My place is by your side I shouldnt have left you alone with these people
daenerys	These people ?
jorah	They are not to be trusted
daenerys	And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse
jorah	Your people are in Westeros
daenerys	The people in Westeros dont know Im alive
jorah	They will soon enough
daenerys	And then what? Theyll pray for my return? Theyll wave dragon banners and shout my name? Thats what my brother believed and he was a fool
daenerys	You are not your brother
jorah	Trust me, Khaleesi
daenerys	There it is Trust me And its you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I dont need trust any longer I dont want it and I dont have room for it
jorah	You are too young to be so
daenerys	And you are too familiar
jorah	Forgive me, Khaleesi No one can survive in this world without help No one Let me help you, please Tell me how
daenerys	Find my dragons
ygritte	How long till we get back to your crows?
jon	Were close
ygritte	What, a day? A half-day? You dont know, do you? Do you even know where they are?
jon	Were close
ygritte	What do you think theyll say when they hear about you and me?
jon	Nothing happened between you and me
ygritte	I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club I can show you the bruise on me tailbone And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like And I didnt want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined The shame of it Now I can never marry a perfumed lord What will me poor savage father say?
jon	Turn back around
ygritte	And I thought that we were done, but he said, Turn back around Ill tell you what, Jon Snow Since its gonna be your word against mine, and since you cant talk about it without blushing, we may as well just
jon	What, right here in the muck?
ygritte	Ill keep you warm enough
ygritte	Are you that afraid of it?
jon	Thats enough
ygritte	Its nice and wet and warm
jon	Enough
ygritte	It dont have teeth
ygritte	All right! All right Gods, youre dull
ygritte	Should have took me while you had the chance
sansa	No, no
sansa	No Oh, no
shae	Its all right Give me that
sansa	If the Queen sees, I can have Joffreys children now
shae	Help me flip it over
shae	Where are you going?
handmaiden	To tell Her Grace
shae	Youll say nothing to anyone Do you understand?
cersei	Your mother might have prepared you You flowered, my dear No more
sansa	My mother told me, but I thought it would be different
cersei	In what way?
sansa	I thought it would be less Less messy
cersei	Wait until you birth a child
cersei	Youre a woman now Do you have any idea what that means?
sansa	Im fit to bear children for the king?
cersei	A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen
cersei	Joffrey has always been difficult Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world You cannot imagine the pain I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood
sansa	His Grace was not with you?
cersei	Robert was hunting That was his custom Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stags head, and I would present him with a baby Not that I wanted him there, mind you I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother When they told Jaime he wasnt allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out Joffrey will show you no such devotion
cersei	You may never love the king, but you will love his children
sansa	I love His Grace with all my heart
cersei	Thats so very touching to hear Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day The more people you love, the weaker you are Youll do things for them that you know you shouldnt do Youll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe Love no one but your children On that front, a mother has no choice
sansa	But shouldnt I love Joffrey, Your Grace?
cersei	You can try, little dove
cersei	Who did you say your mother was again?
alton	Cinda Lannister
jaime	Is she the fat one?
alton	Well, perhaps shes gotten a little larger than she
jaime	No, no Theres only one fat Lannister If she was your mother, youd know it
alton	I squired for you once, you know
jaime	When?
alton	The tournament, the day of Willem Freys wedding
jaime	I went to Willem Freys wedding?
alton	You did Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up
jaime	He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds What was his name?
alton	Bryan
jaime	Poor lad That was my brothers doing, I seem to recall I remember you Youd never squired for anyone before
alton	Thats right I ran up and volunteered Let me, my lord Let me My father was furious Afraid Id embarrass our family in front of the Family
jaime	You didnt, though
alton	You really remember?
jaime	You knew when you were needed and when to go away Its a rare talent Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them
alton	When I think back to that day
guard	Shh
jaime	You were saying?
alton	I Never mind Its embarrassing
jaime	More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
alton	I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me Ill remember it all until I die That was the best day of my life And I remember being on the field after it was over All the competitors were done I was the last one out there And I couldnt leave I couldnt bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride And I couldnt bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about
jaime	I understand completely
alton	How could you? Sorry, I I didnt mean to doubt you
jaime	Its just that I I was 16 once I also had to replace someones squire on short notice
alton	Which knight was it?
jaime	Barristan Selmy The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws Before your time
alton	What was he like?
jaime	He was A painter A painter who only used red I couldnt imagine being able to fight like that, not back then And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect I dont need to explain how that felt, not to you
alton	Its hard to put into words
jaime	Its like stepping into a dream youve been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life
alton	Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison
alton	Did you squire for him again?
jaime	No I didnt have your gift He couldnt take a step without stepping on me I was awful, a complete liability Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire
jaime	Its a good thing I am who I am Id have been useless at anything else Im not well-suited for imprisonment Shocking, I know Some men are Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end Not me, though My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint
alton	And have you thought about
jaime	Of course Every day
alton	And?
jaime	Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently The Starks are very careful
jaime	But there is a way, I think It wasnt possible until now
alton	What is it?
jaime	Its actually quite simple
alton	Well, let me help you
jaime	Youll only have to do one thing
alton	Tell me
jaime	Youll have to die
quaith	Jorah the Andal This man must sail past old Valyria All who travel too close to the doom must have protection
jorah	I didnt come here for lessons
quaith	No, you came for the dragons
jorah	You have them? Where are they?
quaith	Draw your sword See what your steel is worth You want to please the Mother of Dragons
quaith	You love her
jorah	Where are the dragons?
quaith	Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?
quaith	Will you betray her again?
jorah	Never
quaith	The thief you seek is with her now
spice king	I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief
xaro	No one is calling you a thief Who is she to accuse us?
daenerys	Please, theyre my children Im begging you
silk king	Begging us? It wasnt very long ago you were threatening us
daenerys	Without me, the dragons will die
spice king	It will be for the best Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear If I knew where they were, I would not tell you
pyat pree	You are cruel, my friend The Mother of Dragons is in the right She must be reunited with her babies I will help you, Khaleesi
daenerys	How?
pyatt pree	I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them
daenerys	You have my dragons?
pyatt pree	When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth He procured them for me
daenerys	But there is no King of Qarth
xaro	There is now That was the other half of the arrangement
xaro	You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me
spice king	Your ambition is an inspiration But like all upstarts, you overreach Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king
xaro	An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise
pyatt pree	The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever
pyatt pree	A mother should be with her children
pyatt pree	Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying Come see them
jacks	Lady Stark
brienne	No farther
jacks	Keep your hands off me, woman
brienne	Dont enter without an invitation, man
jacks	Forgive me Lady Stark
catelyn	What is it?
jacks	They caught the Kingslayer
man	Kingslayer
man	Kill the fucking Kingslayer
man	Hang him
man	Hang him
man	Youll die today
man	Justice for the Karstark
man	Gut him
rickard kar	Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death
catelyn	Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner
rickard	This monster killed my son
catelyn	And crippled mine He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here
rickard kar	I will have his head And if you try and stop me
catelyn	You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark I am the mother of your king
rickard kar	And where is our king now?
robb	You know very well
rickard kar	He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate He brought that foreign bitch with him
catelyn	How dare you
brienne	Threatening my lady is an act of treason
rickard kar	Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
catelyn	I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down
rickard kar	When your son returns, I will demand this murderers head
catelyn	Wise men do not make demands of kings
rickard kar	Fathers who love their sons do I will have his head
jaime	Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark I would have come to your defense
but catelyn	Take him to the stockades Bind him with every chain you can find
jaime	Youve become a real she-wolf in your later years Theres not much fish left in you
catelyn	And gag him
tyrion	Since when do you light your own candles?
cersei	Since I decided that I cant stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant
cersei	How many times can you read one raven scroll?
tyrion	Stannis Baratheons fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships
cersei	More than we have
tyrion	Yes, thats more than we have Hell be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind
cersei	We have strong, high walls Well rain fire down on them from above
tyrion	Rain fire on them from above Youre quoting Father, arent you?
cersei	Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesnt he?
tyrion	Call it tactics, not strategy But, yes, he does have a good mind for it The best mind, some would say Sadly, hes not here Its just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
cersei	Im sure youll make a point eventually
tyrion	He needs to start acting like a king This war you started is coming to our doorstep And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
cersei	Im not the one giving the boy whores to abuse
tyrion	I thought the girls might help him
cersei	Did you?
tyrion	I was wrong If we cant control him
cersei	Do you think I havent tried? He doesnt listen to me
tyrion	Its hard to put a leash on a dog once youve put a crown on its head
cersei	I always hoped hed be like Jaime He looks like him In a certain light
tyrion	The boy is more Robert than Jaime
cersei	Robert was a drunken fool, but he didnt enjoy cruelty Sometimes I wonder What? If this is the price for what weve done, for our sins
tyrion	Sins?
cersei	The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know Thats what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt Its what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me Half the Targaryens went mad, didnt they? Whats the saying? Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin
tyrion	Youve beaten the odds Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them
man	Then why wait?
man	Were sworn to the king
man	Theres not a king
man	Thats treason
man	So is saving Lannisters, yeah?
man	Back off, you
man	No, I wont
brienne	Your son returns at dawn, my lady?
catelyn	So they say
brienne	ingslayer wont last the night The more they drink, the angrier theyll get And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?
catelyn	Come
catelyn	I need to be alone with him
guard	My lady
our orders catelyn	Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him
jaime	Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe its my last night in this world Is that a woman?
catelyn	Do you hear them out there? They want your head
jaime	Old Lord Karstark doesnt seem to like me
catelyn	You strangled his son with your chains
jaime	Oh Oh Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way Any knight would have done the same
catelyn	You are no knight You have forsaken every vow you ever took
jaime	So many vows They make you swear and swear Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? Its too much No matter what you do, youre forsaking one vow or another Where did you find this beast?
catelyn	She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer
jaime	Kingslayer What a king he was Heres to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back
catelyn	You are a man without honor
jaime	Do you know, Ive never been with any woman but Cersei So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned What was the name of that bastard he fathered?
catelyn	Brienne
jaime	No, that wasnt it Snow, a bastard from the North Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whores baby, did you pretend to love it? No Youre not very good at pretending Youre an honest woman You hated that boy, didnt you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman
catelyn	Your sword
theon	I told you what would happen All of you I told you what would happen if you served me loyally And what would happen if you did not
luwin	What are you doing? What have you done?
theon	If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question
luwin	No
man	Riders approaching
mar	Open the gate
yara	Why, its the Prince of Winterfell
theon	Envy isnt attractive
yara	What envy?
theon	You should be proud of your brothers achievement I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men
yara	Youre a great warrior I saw the bodies above your gates Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?
theon	I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery
yara	You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
theon	Before I had to kill them, I treated them
yara	You seized their home, as is your right Were ironborn, we take what we need
theon	Exactly
yara	Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away Is that treachery? Id call it bravery
theon	They made me a promise
yara	Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
theon	Dont call me
yara	A cunt A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell You know how valuable those boys were?
theon	If I hadnt killed them, the Northerners would think me weak
yara	You are weak And youre stupid
theon	Im warning you
yara	Go on, then Warn me
theon	You havent brought enough men How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
yara	Youre not Ive come to bring you home Father wants a word
theon	Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North
yara	Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea Were islanders, baby brother Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships And now that youve decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged When Robb Stark finds out
theon	He wont find out Weve killed all the ravens We have all the horses Ive taken Winterfell And I will keep Winterfell
yara	Leave us
yara	Theon, youre my blood We both loved our mother We both endured our father Come home with me Dont die here alone
theon	I dont intend to die
yara	You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping And one night, you just wouldnt shut up, screaming like a dying pig I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you I wanted to strangle you And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming You smiled at me Dont die so far from the sea
ygritte	Ive brought you a present, Lord of Bones
lord of bones	I already got one crow Dont need two
ygritte	Mance will want to question this one Knows all about where the crows are and what theyre planning
lord of bones	The Halfhand knows more This one is just a little boy Gut him
ygritte	He could have killed me half a dozen times
lord of bones	And now he wishes he did Gut him
ygritte	Hes a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Starks son Mance will want him
lord of bones	What does Mance want with a dead mans bastard?
ygritte	I dont know I think hell want to decide for himself
lord of bones	He runs, Ill chop his balls off
ygritte	He runs, Ill do it meself
ygritte	Were even now, Jon Snow
jon	I couldnt do it I had the sword on her neck
i just couldnt qhorin	I know
jon	The others?
qhorin	When you didnt come back, we went looking for you We found your tracks fast enough But they found us before we found you
jon	They died because of me
qhorin	See that it wasnt for nothing
wildling	All right, up, lad
wildling	Come on, on your feet, now Move it
talisa	Is she beautiful?
robb	Ive never met her
talisa	Whats her name?
robb	Frey, I suppose I dont know her first name
talisa	Im sure youll be very happy
talisa	And youre marrying her for a bridge?
robb	An important bridge
talisa	Ah
robb	It was before they killed my father I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge
talisa	When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father
robb	He was the best man I ever met I know children always think that about their fathers
but talisa	Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me
robb	He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect The soldiers you order into battle He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night I didnt believe him I asked him, How can a man be brave if hes afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave, he told me
talisa	I wish I could have met him
robb	He would have liked you
talisa	Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors
robb	He didnt care much about gold or glory
talisa	And you? You think Im fighting this war so theyll sing songs about me? I want to go home I want the men following me to go home
talisa	Then why dont you?
robb	Because well never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated And because I believe in justice
talisa	Chopping off Joffreys head, you mean
robb	That would be a start
rider	Your Grace, milady ingslayer, he escaped in the night
robb	How? How?
robb	Tell me this isnt true
robb	Why?
catelyn	For the girls
robb	You betrayed me
robb robb	No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway
catelyn	Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell Sansa and Arya are captives in Kings Landing I have five children, and only one of them is free
rickard kar	I lost one son fighting by your sons side I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell
catelyn	I grieve for your sons, my lord
rickard kar	I dont want your grief I want my vengeance And you stole it from me
catelyn	Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to Kings Landing may buy life for mine
robb	Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool Youve weakened our position Youve brought discord into our camp And you did it all behind my back Make sure shes guarded day and night
catelyn	Robb How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
soldier	Forty, Your Grace
robb	Send another 40 with our fastest horses
catelyn	Robb
jaime	Damn
jaime	Youre much uglier in daylight Whats your name? Im Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin
jaime	A captive knight has a right to know his captors identity
brienne	Brienne of Tarth
jaime	Tarth, Tarth, Tarth Crescent moons and starbursts Lord Selwyn Tarth Your father Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? Its a long way to Kings Landing Might as well get to know one another
jaime	Have you known many men? I suppose not Women? Horses? Ah
jaime	I didnt mean to give offense, my lady Forgive me
brinenne	Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer
jaime	Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
brinenne	Youve harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent
jaime	Has anyone ever told you youre as boring as you are ugly?
brinenne	You will not provoke me to anger
jaime	I already have Look at you Youre ready to chop my head off Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
brinenne	Ive never seen you fight
jaime	The answer is no There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me Youre not one of them
brienne	All my life men like you have sneered at me And all my life Ive been knocking men like you into the dust
jaime	If youre so confident, unlock my chains Lets see what happens
brinenne	Do you take me for an idiot? In
jaime	I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon Woman of honor Was I wrong? Youre afraid
brinenne	Maybe one day well find out, Kingslayer
kevan	Kings Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force Its not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety
tywin	Surrender the Iron Throne?
kevan	Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates Stannis will execute them all
tywin	No, a king who runs will not be king for long Hes a Lannister Hell stand and fight Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep
kevan	The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark
tywin	Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Starks movement, he lured us into a trap Which is why my son is his prisoner
twyin	Too close to Casterly Rock
kevan	He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell The Greyjoys have done us a great favor Stark wont risk marching on Casterly Rock until hes at full force
tywin	Hes a boy and hes never lost a battle Hell risk anything at any time because he doesnt know enough to be afraid
tywin	Well ride at nightfall I want a full nights march before he knows were on the move Clegane, youll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal Track down this brotherhood and destroy them The girl has proven herself a good servant Shell stay on with you See that he doesnt get drunk in the evenings Hes poor company when hes sober, but hes better at his work
guard	Youve got some questions to answer
man	Who killed Ser Amory?
man	I dont know! Please
man	Give me the name Take this one out for the crows
man	I told you, I dont know Please
rorge	Look, its Yorens little cunt Used to be a boy, now its a girl
arya	Wheres Jaqen?
rorge	Dont care Wheres your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it
guard	Come on, time to kill some wolves
hot pie	You need sour cherries to make it right And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet Thats where the real flavor is You crush em up real fine And then when youre finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust
arya	Wheres Jaqen?
hot pie	How would I know?
arya	I need him now Lord Tywins marching tonight
gendry	You need him?
arya	Hes helping me
hot pie	I saw him
arya	Where?
arya	Where?
hot pie	Ow
arya	Where?
hot pie	They went riding out the gates a few hours ago
hot pie	On patrol Let go of my ears
hot pie	What do you want with him anyway?
quorin	Mance is gonna march on the Wall When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it
jon	Theyll never trust me
jaime	Those were Stark men
brienne	I dont serve the Starks I serve Lady Catelyn I told you Id take you to Kings Landing, and thats what Im going to do Stay
catelyn	Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross
robb	I know that
catelyn	Your father didnt love me when we married He hardly knew me or I him Love didnt just happen to us We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us Its not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger It lasts longer
robb	And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Freys daughters, what you and father had?
catelyn	Why not? Because shes not beautiful? Because shes not exotic and exciting?
robb	Now youre arguing just to argue because you arranged it
catelyn	And you agreed to it You gave him your word Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same If your father lived his life for one thing
robb	My father is dead And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless
stannis	You said you saw my victory in the flames
melisandre	l I did I still see it
stannis	The flames lied And Im no better than a savage trusting in a fire god I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells If you see so much in your flames, why didnt you warn me?
melisandre	The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses
stannis	You claimed to speak for a god
melisandre	Will you quit the war just because youve lost a battle?
stannis	You talk about war as if you understand it
melisandre	Ive been fighting far longer than you
stannis	Have you? Show me how you fight
stannis	Show me
stannis	Wheres your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
melisandre	Inside you
stannis	I murdered my brother
melisandre	We murdered him Share the weight with me
stannis	He wasnt your brother
melisandre	This war has just begun It will last for years Thousands will die at your command You will betray the men serving you You will betray your family You will betray everything you once held dear And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire You are the Warrior of Light You will sweep aside this pretender and that one You will be king
stannis	You promise these things, but you dont know None of us know
melisandre	Let me show you
melisandre	Look into the fire, my king Look
stannis	I see fire
melisandre	Keep looking Do you see? Do you see, my king?
stannis	Yes
theon	I will kill that man I dont care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall
luwin	They want you to know youre surrounded
theon	I know Im surrounded I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded
luwin	They dont want you to sleep They want to sap your spirit before
theon	Thank you, wise bald man Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me
theon	No word from my father?
luwin	No
theon	Send more ravens
luwin	You killed all the ravens
theon	The first time I saw Winterfell
theon	First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead I saw it and I thought, Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers We never stood a chance against the man who lives here
luwin	Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home
theon	Yes, my captors were so very kind to me You love reminding me of that Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that You know what its like to be told how lucky you are to be someones prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father
theon	I will kill that man I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man
luwin	Theon, listen to me I serve Winterfell Now Winterfell is yours Im bound by oath to serve you
theon	And whats your counsel, trusted friend?
luwin	Run
luwin	Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls You have 20 men You cant win Wait for nightfall and run
theon	Theres nowhere to run Id never make it back to the Iron Islands And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, Id be a coward The Greyjoy who ran The shame of the family
luwin	Dont go home Join the Nights Watch
luwin	Once a man has taken the black, hes beyond reach of the law All his past crimes are forgiven
theon	I wont make it to the Wall I wont make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates
luwin	There are ways Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape The road will be dangerous But with a little luck.
luwin	The Nights Watch is an ancient, honorable order Youll have opportunities there
theon	The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep
luwin	The opportunity to make amends for what youve done
theon	Ive done a lot, havent I? Things I never imagined myself doing
luwin	Ive known you many years, Theon Greyjoy Youre not the man youre pretending to be Not yet
theon	You may be right But Ive gone too far to pretend to be anything else
theon	You hear that? Thats the mating call of the Northmen They want to fuck us Well, I havent had a good fuck in weeks Im ready for one
theon	They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland
men	Aye
theon	You think theyre right?
black lorren	Aye
theon	We die today, brothers We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle
men	Aye
theon	Mothers will name their sons for us
men	Aye
theon	Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them
men	Aye
theon	And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke
men	Aye
theon	What is dead may never die
men	What is dead may never die
black lorren	Thought hed never shut up
dagmer	It was a good speech Didnt want to interrupt
luwin	What is this? What are you doing?
dagmer	Lets go home
man	Come on
tyrion	Why should I believe you?
varys	Why would I lie about it?
tyrion	To create strife between my sister and me
varys	Where before there was nothing but love Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sisters orders If it werent for your squires bravery, youd be a dead man
tyrion	Pod
podrick	Yes, my lord?
tyrion	Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
podrick	No, my lord
tyrion	Youre a good lad Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times
varys	Im afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister It varies from cloak to cloak
tyrion	Then my hill tribesmen
varys	Have gone home Your father paid them quite handsomely Im afraid we wont be seeing each other for some time, my lord
tyrion	Dont want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends
varys	We are Podrick, would you mind?
varys	There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat The king wont give you any honors, the histories wont mention you, but we will not forget
varys	Come along now, Podrick

jaqen	If you would learn, you must come with me
arya	Where?
jaqen	Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos
arya	My dancing master was from Braavos
jaqen	To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely The girl has many names on her lips Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound Names to offer up to the Red God She could offer them all one by one
arya	I want to But I cant I need to find my brother and mother And my sister I need to find her, too

jon	What happened to their fathers?
ygritte	Some of them were killed by crows like you Dont look so grim, Jon Snow If Mance Rayder likes you, youll live another day And if he dont.
tormund	I smell a crow
lord of bones	We killed his friends Thought youd want to question this one
tormund	What do we want with a baby crow?
ygritte	This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand He wants to be one of us
tormund	That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine Friends twice your size
jon	My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts
tormund	Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart And theres plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods Whats your name, boy?
jon	Jon Snow
jon	Your Grace
tormund	Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, youd better kneel every time I fart
mance	Stand, boy We dont kneel for anyone beyond the Wall
mance	So, youre Ned Starks bastard Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones You can leave us
mance	The girl likes you You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?
tormund	Dont panic, boy This isnt the damned Nights Watch where we make you swear off girls
mance	This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane
tormund	Cant believe this pup killed the Halfhand
mance	He was our enemy and Im glad hes dead
mance	He was my brother once Back when he had a whole hand What were you doing with him?
jon	The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning
mance	Why?
jon	He wants me to lead one day
mance	But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall
jon	If Im a traitor, then you are, too
mance	Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?
jon	I want to be free
mance	No, I dont think so I think what you want most of all is to be a hero Ill ask you one last time why do you want to join us?
jon	We stopped at Crasters Keep on the way north I saw.
mance	You saw what?
jon	I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods I saw what took it
mance	Youre telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
jon	Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them I want to fight for the side that fights for the living Did I come to the right place?
mance	Well need to find you a new cloak
bronn	What if you took off that bit there?
whore	Dont you want to leave something to the imagination?
bronn	Trouble is, Ive never had much imagination
whore	I want you to take it off
whore	Mouth
podrick	Ser Bronn Ser Bronn
bronn	I didnt hear that
podrick	Apologies, ser
bronn	Back away Keep backing away till youre outside this establishment Then back away some more
podrick	Lord Tyrion sent me
bronn	I will murder you, boy
podrick	He said it was a matter of life and death
tyrion	Pod?
cersei	Its your sister The queen
tyrion	What are they doing here?
cersei	Protecting me, I assume Will you let me in?
tyrion	No, I dont think so
cersei	If I wanted to kill you, do you think Id let a wooden door stop me?
tyrion	They stay outside
cersei	Im not afraid of you, little brother
tyrion	Why are you here?
cersei	I wanted to see your face They said youd lost your nose, but its not as gruesome as all that
tyrion	The man who cut me lost more than his nose
cersei	I should hope so The rebels came for Joffreys head, they lost their own Thanks to Father
tyrion	Thanks to Father Of course, it wasnt a rebel who tried to kill me
cersei	No? Curious Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand But then I dont suppose you need much room
tyrion	Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees
cersei	Youre meeting Father today?
tyrion	How do you know that?
cersei	Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two Father told me What do you want from him?
tyrion	What do I want from him? Hes my father Do I need to want something? Im sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy Yet he hasnt come to visit once since arriving in Kings Landing I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came
cersei	Youre going to make me cry
tyrion	Why do you care what I want from him?
cersei	Because youve slandered me to Father before
tyrion	Slandered? When?
cersei	You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock
tyrion	You did have your guards beat her A girl of nine, I believe
cersei	I was nine, too
tyrion	She lost an eye, if I remember correctly
cersei	If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again
tyrion	Its not slander if its true
cersei	And whats this truth you plan on telling him today?
tyrion	Why are you so nervous about what Im going to say to Father?
cersei	Because youre a liar I expect youll tell lies about me, about Joffrey
tyrion	Any lies in particular?
cersei	Youre a clever man, but youre not half as clever as you think you are
tyrion	Still makes me more clever than you
bronn	Oh, look at these two shining warriors Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares
meryn trant	Ser Meryn Trant
bronn	Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
meryn trant	Youre no knight
bronn	Pod
podrick	Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself
meryn trant	Youre an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more
bronn	Thats exactly who I am And youre a grub in fancy armor whos better at beating little girls than fighting men Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion
meryn trant	You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand
bronn	As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me
tyrion	A number of people in this city want to kill me Youre here to protect me
bronn	Ive been doing that for a while now
tyrion	Do you grow bored protecting me?
bronn	I grow poor protecting you
tyrion	Poor? Poor? Under my patronage youve become a knight, youve served as Commander of the City Watch
bronn	Briefly
tyrion	Im sure you filled your pockets
bronn	And now my pockets are empty Youve given me a taste for the finer things And if you want me to carry on protecting you, youll need to pay more
tyrion	I thought we were friends
bronn	We are But Im a sellsword I sell my sword I dont loan it out to friends as a favor
tyrion	How much?
bronn	Double
tyrion	Double?
bronn	Im a knight now Knights are worth double
tyrion	I dont even know how much Im paying you now
bronn	Which means you can afford it
blackwater bay davos	Here Here! Help me
man	Who are you?
davos	I was in the battle at Blackwater I was a captain and a knight
man	Aye, ser, and serving which king?
davos	The one true king of Westeros Stannis Baratheon
salladhor	I thought you were dead Everyone thought you were dead And your son?
salladhor	He may have swam ashore as you did
davos	No, the wildfire took him I saw it
salladhor	Im so sorry, my friend I, too, have lost a son There is nothing worse in this world But, Davos, you were a good father
davos	If I was a good father, hed still be here Stannis lives?
salladhor	He licks his wounds at Dragonstone
davos	Will you take me there?
salladhor	There is nothing for me at Dragonstone
davos	This war is not over
salladhor	Not for you, maybe But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over
davos	Were both sworn to King Stannis
salladhor	I am sworn to no man I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory I delivered the ships
davos	Stannis never gives up Never Now he will regroup .
salladhor	Hes a broken man His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay They say he sees no one not his generals, not even his wife Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive
davos	What?
salladhor	They built a great fire when Stannis returned All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness They say she sang to them as they burned
salladhor	Im a pirate
davos	Youre a smuggler
salladhor	Servants of darkness Im thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid
davos	Take me back there, please
salladhor	You cannot turn Stannis against her
davos	Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out
salladhor	You could try If you fail, they will burn you If you succeed, theyll burn you And youve only just come back to life Stay alive a little longer, my friend
davos	You call me friend You drank with me on my wedding day
salladhor	And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I dont ask you for favors
davos	I have to stop her Please, do this for me
salladhor	When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck
roose bolton	We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal
robb	There wont be a siege The Mountain cant defend a ruin
roose bolton	I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend
robb	The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross Id love a fight The men would love a fight I dont think were going to get one
rickard kar	200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep
roose bolton	The debt will be repaid, my friend For them and for your sons
rickard kar	Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free
roose bolton	ingslayer wont remain free for long My best hunters are after him
robb	A Mallister?
catelyn	Ser Jeremy My fathers bannerman
robb	Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell
talisa	Shes your mother
robb	She freed Jaime Lannister The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice
qyburn	Water Water
talisa	This needs to be cleaned and closed
robb	Whats your name, friend?
qyburn	Qyburn
talisa	Youre lucky to be alive
qyburn	Lucky?
tyrion	The badge looks good on you Almost as good as it looked on me Are you enjoying your new position?
tywin	Am I enjoying it?
tyrion	I was very happy as Hand of the King
tywin	Yes I heard how happy you were You brought a whore into my bed
tyrion	It wasnt your bed at the time
tywin	I sent you here to advise the king I gave you real power and authority You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves
tyrion	Occasionally I drank with the harlots
tywin	What do you want, Tyrion?
tyrion	Why does everyone assume I want something? Cant I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield
tywin	Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal
tyrion	I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls I bled in the mud for our family And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start
tywin	Jugglers and singers require applause You are a Lannister Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion So tell me what you want
tyrion	I want what is mine by right Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock I am your son and lawful heir
tywin	You want Casterly Rock?
tyrion	It is mine by right
tywin	Well find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock
tyrion	Why?
tywin	Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning Mens laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my fathers sigil and his fathers before him But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse Go, now Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock Go
tywin	Oh, one more thing The next whore I catch in your bed Ill hang
sansa	Dorne Its going to Dorne
shae	Why Dorne?
sansa	Its carrying silk and its supposed to bring back wine in exchange But its not coming back The captains tired of risking his life so Kings Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve Hes going to stay in Dorne Wait out the winter where its beautiful and warm
shae	I met some people in Dorne who werent so beautiful and warm
sansa	Dont ruin the game
shae	I told you, I dont want to play
sansa	What about that one there?
shae	That one? Its going to Volantis
sansa	Why?
shae	Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one
sansa	Thats not how the game works Youre not supposed to just blurt out the right answer Youve got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why
shae	Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
sansa	Because the truth is always either terrible or boring
littlefinger	Lovely day for it Watching the ships
sansa	Lord Baelish
littlefinger	Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
littlefinger	I saw your mother not long ago Shes very eager to see you And your sister
sansa	Aryas alive? You said youd take me home
littlefinger	You said Kings Landing was your home You are the property of the crown Stealing you would be treason If you were to tell just one person .
sansa	I wont tell anyone
littlefinger	How do I know?
sansa	Because Im a terrible liar You said so yourself Please, Lord Baelish Tell me what to do Tell me when
littlefinger	Im waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me But youll need to be ready to leave on a moments notice
ros	Youre her handmaiden?
shae	Yes And youre his ?
ros	I help manage his affairs
shae	Hes an important person
ros	So is she I grew up in the shadow of her fathers castle The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset Weve both done rather well, you and I
shae	Yes
ros	Given where we started
shae	And where is that?
ros	Its not easy for girls like us to dig our way out Watch out for her
shae	I always do
ros	Watch out for her with him
jorah	Theyre growing fast
daenerys	Not fast enough I cant wait that long I need an army
jorah	Well be in Astapor by nightfall Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world
daenerys	The greatest slave-soldiers in the world The distinction means a good deal to some people
jorah	Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
daenerys	Its too beautiful a day to argue
jorah	Youre right Another lovely day on the high seas
daenerys	Dont mock them Theyre the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship They followed me across the poison water If theyll do it, others will And with a true khalasar .
jorah	The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi Youll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong And not before
davos	Your Grace
stannis	I heard you were dead
davos	Not yet
stannis	I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace
stannis	We are alone
davos	Your Grace, you are the rightful king Not only by blood Youre an honorable man, a just man And there is still a war to fight
stannis	I am fighting
davos	By burning prisoners alive?
melisandre	How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?
davos	I do not judge people for the gods they worship If I did, Id have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone
melisandre	Im not your enemy
davos	You are my enemy
melisandre	Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasnt there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands I could have saved those men You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him But I wasnt there because you convinced your king to leave me behind Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them
melisandre	Dont despair, Ser Davos What I told your son is true
melisandre	Death by fire is the purest death
davos	This woman is evil! Shes the mother of demons
stannis	Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell
davos	Your Grace
guard	Come on
melisandre	Youve chosen the darkness, Ser Davos
davos	She will destroy us all
melisandre	I will pray for you
davos	Your Grace
guard	Halt Down
guard	Halt Down
joffrey	Why have we stopped?
guard	Its Lady Margaery, Your Grace
joffrey	What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
maid	My lady We should have guards, my lady
margaery	Why?
margaery	Pardon me
maid	Stop, my lady Youll ruin your dress
margaery	I have others
guard	Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?
joffrey	No
child	He was a soldier He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay He never came back
margaery	And your mother?
child	She died when she had me
margaery	Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them
margaery	Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father
child	He wasnt a knight He was just a soldier
margaery	And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good Your father did that Be proud of him
margaery	Was your father a soldier, too?
margaery	You should be proud, too Under King Joffreys leadership, your fathers saved the city They saved us all From now on, were going to take care of you All of you
margaery	Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them Directly to me
margaery	Your Grace
loras	Your Grace
joffrey	Please, sit Sit I do apologize, my lady Small council meetings At what point does it become treason to waste the kings time?
joffrey	Thats a lovely gown, my lady
cersei	Yes, it suits you perfectly I imagine you might be rather cold
margaery	The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace
joffrey	Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?
margaery	I am touched by your concern, Your Grace Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm Doesnt it, Loras?
loras	Yes
margaery	Loras, isnt the queens gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork Ive never seen anything like it
cersei	You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen Perhaps before Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning
margaery	Yes I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about
loras	Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden
margaery	The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart
cersei	An open heart is what youll get in Flea Bottom if youre not careful, my dear Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there We had a full complement of guards that didnt stop them The king barely escaped with his life
joffrey	My mothers always had a penchant for drama Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older Our lives were never truly in danger
cersei	Youre right, of course But you are your fathers son We cant all have a kings bravery
margaery	Hunger turns men into beasts Im glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach Wheat, barley, apples Weve had a blessed harvest And, of course, its our duty to assist the capital in time of need
joffrey	Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of charitable work before Im sure she knows what shes doing
cersei	Im sure she does
cut to	The path leading to Astapor KRAZNYS MO
missandei	The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water
missandei	They will stand until they drop
missandei	Such is their obedience
daenerys	They may suit my needs Tell me of their training
missandei	The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down She wished to know how they are trained
kraznys mo nakloz	Tell her what she would know and be quick about it
missandei	They begin their training at five Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training
missandei	Their discipline and loyalty are absolute They fear nothing
jorah	Even the bravest men fear death
missandei	The knight says even brave men fear death
kraznys mo nakloz	Tell the old man he smells of piss
missandei	Truly, master?
kraznys mo nakloz	No, not truly Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?
missandei	My master says the Unsullied are not men Death means nothing to them
kraznys mo nakloz	Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch
missandei	He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace
daenerys	Tell the good master there is no need
kraznys mo nakloz	Shes worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know weve cut off their balls?
missandei	My master points out that men dont need nipples
kraznys mo nakloz	Here, Im done with you
unsullied	This one is pleased to have served you
missandei	To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mothers eyes This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them
daenerys	You take a babe from its mothers arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?
missandei	She is offended She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby

daenerys	Once I own them, these men .
jorah	Theyre not men Not anymore
daenerys	Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?
jorah	Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
jorah	Youll be fair to them You wont mutilate them to make a point
jorah	You wont order them to murder babies Youll see theyre properly fed and sheltered A great injustice has been done to them Closing your eyes will not undo it
daenerys	The warlocks
daenerys	I owe you my life, ser
barristan selmy	The honor is mine, my queen

robb	Did you ever think youd marry one?
talisa	I never thought Id marry anyone at all
robb	Never?
talisa	Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians
roose bolton	Pardon me, Your Grace My queen
talisa	Lord Bolton

robb	Well travel to the funeral together Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return
catelyn	Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
catelyn	Something else?
robb	By the time Boltons bastard-RAMSAY got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch And BRAN and RICKON have not been found They may have escaped Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages
catelyn	Have you received any demands?
robb	No
catelyn	Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
theon	Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
torturer	I want to do this
jaime	Do you know how long its going to take us to get to Kings Landing walking through fields and forests?
brienne	Yes
jaime	So how shall we pass the time?
brienne	By putting one foot in front of the other
jaime	Its going to be a very dull walk
brienne	Im here to take you to Kings Landing and bring back Lady Starks daughters in exchange Dull is fine
jaime	You know, it doesnt matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute Trust me on this People have been serving me since I was born You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A weeks journey with you and shell order you to fall on your sword
brienne	If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, Im sure shell let me know Shes an honest woman
jaime	All the good its done her
jaime	How did you come into Lady Starks service? Theres something we can talk about
brienne	Not your concern, Kingslayer
jaime	It had to be recently You werent with her at Winterfell
brienne	How would you know?
jaime	Because I visited Winterfell I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways
brienne	Move
jaime	Were you pledged to Stannis?
brienne	Gods, no
jaime	Ah, Renly Really? He wasnt fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal
brienne	Shut your mouth
jaime	Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, dont forget Could hardly escape the little tulip Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks I knew him far better than you
brienne	I knew him as well as anyone As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything He would have been a wonderful king
jaime	Sounds like you quite fancied him
brienne	I did not fancy him
jaime	Oh, gods, you did
jaime	Did you ever tell him? No, of course not You werent Renlys type, Im afraid
jaime	He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell Youre far too much man for him
brienne	Im not interested in foul rumors
jaime	Unless theyre about me Its all true about Renly His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court Its a shame the throne isnt made out of cocks Theyd have never got him off it
brienne	Shut your mouth
jaime	I dont blame him And I dont blame you, either We dont get to choose who we love
man	Where are you headed, then?
brienne	South You?
man	Riverrun Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go You cant win
jaime	No, you really cant
man	Looks like youre safe enough, though Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldnt tangle with you Seven blessings to you
brienne	And you
jaime	He knows who I am
brienne	He doesnt
jaime	Maybe youre right But what if youre not? What if he tells someone?
brienne	Were not doing it Hes an innocent man
jaime	More innocent than Lady Starks daughters?
joffrey	Make it tighter here
cersei	Thats better It makes you look very strong
joffrey	No flowers I said no flowers All these are wrong Bring others
tailor	Yes, Your Grace
joffrey	Bloody flowers On the king
cersei	Looks like a Tyrell rose Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown Should be more than enough fabric
cersei	Tell me what you think of her
joffrey	Who?
cersei	Margaery
joffrey	Shes an ideal match With the Tyrells beside us, well crush the Northerners Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century
cersei	It is a good match, but what do you think of her? Shes beautiful and intelligent
joffrey	Yes, she is
cersei	Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting
joffrey	Not to me
cersei	I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself
joffrey	This is becoming one of the most boring conversations Ive ever had
cersei	Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason She dresses like a harlot for a reason She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason
joffrey	She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to Thats what intelligent women do-what theyre told
cersei	You need to ask yourself
joffrey	I dont need to do anything
joffrey	Better Much better
shae	I still dont believe it
sansa	He didnt He didnt want anything He just takes an interest because he loved my mother
shae	Men only want one thing from a pretty girl
sansa	Littlefingers not in love with me
shae	Love is not the thing he wants
sansa	Hes too old
shae	They never see it that way He didnt ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or?
sansa	No
shae	If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me
sansa	Why? What will you do? I will make him stop
guard	Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady
sansa	Send him in
loras	Lady Sansa
sansa	Ser Loras
loras	My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens May I escort you to them?
loras	I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa
sansa	You are too kind, Ser Loras You probably dont remember the first time we met At the Hands tourney, you gave me your favor A rose, a red rose
loras	Of course I did
margaery	Its more your color You take it
maid	Thank you
margaery	Youre such a dear
loras	Ill take my leave Lady Sansa
sansa	Thank you, Ser Loras
margaery	Come Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell
olenna	Kiss me, child
olenna	Its so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens Were very sorry for your losses
sansa	And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renlys death, Lady Margaery He was very gallant
olenna	Gallant, yes And charming and very clean He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king
margaery	Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother Father liked him and so did Loras
olenna	Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick That does not make him wise As to your fathead father
margaery	Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
olenna	She might think we have some wits about us One of us, at any rate It was treason I warned them Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me But once the cows been milked, theres no squirting the cream back up her udders So here we are to see things through What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?
sansa	Lemon cakes my favorite
olenna	So weve been told Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me Im much less boring than these others
olenna	Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
sansa	I havent had the pleasure
olenna	No great pleasure, believe me A ponderous oaf His father was an oaf as well My husband, the late Lord Luthor He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him And now my son is doing the same, only this time hes riding a lion instead of a horse Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey
sansa	I , I-
olenna	You, you Who else would know better? Weve heard some troubling tales Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?
olenna	Has he ripped out your tongue?
sansa	Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion
olenna	Yes, all Lannisters are lions And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?
margaery	Im to be his wife I only want to know what that means
olenna	Bring me some cheese
servant	The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady
olenna	The cheese will be served when I want it served And I want it served now
olenna	Are you frightened, child? No need for that Were only women here Tell us the truth No harm will come to you
sansa	My father always told the truth
olenna	Yes, he had that reputation And they named him traitor and took his head
sansa	Joffrey Joffrey did that He promised he would be merciful and he cut my fathers head off And he said that was mercy Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it
olenna	Go on
sansa	I-I cant I never meant-my father was a traitor My brother as well I have traitors blood Please dont make me say anymore
margaery	Shes terrified, Grandmother Just look at her
olenna	Speak freely, child We would never betray your confidence, I swear it
sansa	Hes a monster
olenna	Ah Thats a pity
sansa	Please, dont stop the wedding
olenna	Have no fear The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen Even so, we thank you for the truth Ah, here comes my cheese

talisa	Im not afraid of her May I help you, Lady Stark?
catelyn	No

talisa	Youve made them before?
catelyn	Twice
talisa	Did they work?
catelyn	After a fashion I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall
catelyn	Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, hed live But it would be a very long night So I sat with him all through the darkness Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering
talisa	Which boy?
catelyn	Jon Snow When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldnt bear to look at him I didnt want to see those brown strangers eyes staring up at me So I prayed to the gods, take him away Make him die He got the pox And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived A murderer Id condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother A woman he didnt even know So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live Let him live and Ill love him Ill be a mother to him Ill beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us
talisa	And he lived
catelyn	And he lived And I couldnt keep my promise And everything thats happened since then all this horror thats come to my family its all because I couldnt love a motherless child
mance	Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?

mance	You liked him? I like you, but if youre playing us false, it wont be hard for me to kill you Ive got wildling blood in my veins These are my people
jon	I understand
mance	Well, how could you understand?
jon	You want to protect your people

They speak seven different languages in my army The Thenns hate the Hornfoots The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans Everyone hates the cave people So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?

rast	Why? So the rest of us can die? Well move faster without him
jeor	What is this? Get up, Tarly Is he all right?
grenn	Aye, I think so
rast	If he cant, we may as well just go without him
jeor	Thats enough Tarly, I forbid you to die Do you hear me?

arya	Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?
gendry	But you could have ended the war
arya	Where are we going?
gendry	North
arya	If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now
gendry	Maybe we already passed it
arya	Its 100 feet wide How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun My mother grew up there My grandfather hes a lord Hell protect us
gendry	Could be a minstrel
arya	Shut up
thoros	A lion still has claws HOT

shae	That Sansa shouldnt trust him
tyrion	Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
shae	We have to protect her
tyrion	We cant Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors A great beauty with a very old name

guard	Lady Tyrell, my king
joffrey	Send her in
margaery	You wanted to see me, Your Grace?
joffrey	Im leaving on a hunting trip I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left
margaery	Thats very thoughtful, Your Grace I have everything I could want
joffrey	Good Good How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renlys camp
margaery	A welcome one A military encampment is no place for a lady
joffrey	And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
margaery	Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all
joffrey	What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
margaery	The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children
joffrey	You failed to do this
margaery	Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace
joffrey	You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because hes had a sword put through his heart?
margaery	No I do beg your pardon The subtleties of politics are often lost on me Renly I dont believe he was interested in the company of women
joffrey	What makes you say this?
margaery	Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils He never wanted to try Except one evening, after hed had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldnt possibly result in children Maybe the fault was with me
joffrey	No, he was a known degenerate
margaery	Its such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace
joffrey	Mmm Ive considered making his perversion punishable by death
margaery	As is your right You must do whatever you need to do
margaery	You are the king
joffrey	Yes I am
joffrey	Do you like it? I just had it made Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms
margaery	Its beautiful Will you show me how it works?
joffrey	Its a new design Much easier to load Theres no crank You use this lever to draw the string
joffrey	The bolt goes here
joffrey	And then you just aim and
margaery	Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace I know a hunt is no place for a woman
joffrey	Its not unheard of
margaery	My father would never let me before
joffrey	You no longer belong to him Do you want to hold it?
margaery	May I? Please
margaery	I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there
joffrey	Could you do it? Could you kill something?
margaery	I dont know, Your Grace Do you think I could?
joffrey	Yes
margaery	Would you like to watch me?
joffrey	Yes
theon	Stop! Stop
torturer	Tell us the truth
theon	About what?
theon	I dont know what you want
torturer	I want the truth
theon	What truth?
torturer	Whyd you take Winterfell?
theon	I took it to-I took it
torturer	Who gave the orders?
theon	No one I took it on my own
torturer	Why?
theon	To take the North while it was vulnerable
torturer	What were you going to do once you took it?
theon	Hold it Rule it
torturer	Good Thats very good
theon	Why did you do that?
torturer	I told you Why did you take Winterfell?
theon	I took it to bring glory to my house and my father
theon	Wait Wait, wait, wait I took it because I hated the Starks I hated them for holding me prisoner I wanted to hurt them
theon	What are you doing?
theon	Please
theon	Ill tell you anything Just take it off Please Please, just take it off
ramsay	Your sister sent me
theon	Yara?
ramsay	Ill come for you tonight when the castle sleeps
theon	No, dont go Please, please No, please dont leave me Please, please Please, please dont go! Please Please Dont leave me Please dont go
osha	Rickon, stay with us
bran	Its all right The wolves will protect him
jojen	You can get inside his head, see through his eyes
bran	Only when Im asleep
jojen	Thats how it begins until you learn to control it Youre a warg
bran	Its not just wolves Sometimes in my dreams theres a
jojen	A three-eyed raven?
bran	Youve seen it?
jojen	We saw him together You havent forgotten?
bran	Does it have anything to do with warging?
jojen	No, the raven is something different, something deeper The raven brings the sight
bran	Seeing things that havent happened yet?
jojen	Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away
osha	Whats he telling him?
meera	Why dont you ask?
osha	Isnt he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?
meera	Wheres the shame in that?
osha	Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting
meera	Some people will always need help That doesnt mean theyre not worth helping
bran	When my father died, I dreamt it
jojen	You didnt dream it You saw it So did I
bran	You have the sight, too?
jojen	When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry
bran	Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah
jojen	Yeah
bran	He saved my fathers life during the rebellion
jojen	Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did But I saw that, too
bran	What else have you seen?
jojen	Only one thing that matters-you
man	I never liked the skinny ones Like drinking from a puddle Not that Im averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand
arya	I dont drink ale
thoros	Theres no story so good a drink wont make it better
man	Yeah
thoros	You see? Theyve all suffered through my bouts of sobriety Its very tedious for all concerned Now, how did three children
arya	Were not children
thoros	How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?
arya	Gendrys a smith He was apprenticed in the armory
thoros	A smith, eh? Whered you train?
gendry	Kings Landing Tobho Motts shop
thoros	That criminal He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city
gendry	Thats because hes twice as good
thoros	Aha! A smith and a salesman
arya	Gendry stole us weapons
thoros	Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see
arya	He knows how to use a sword and so do I
arya	My brothers taught me
men	Ooh
thoros	To your brothers
thoros	You can finish your meals before you go It may be awhile before you see another
arya	Youll free us?
thoros	I gave you my word But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your
anguy	Hey, hey
thoros	Now that is an uncommonly large person How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
anguy	One waits for him to drink until he passes out
thoros	Poor man You have my sympathy
thoros	Aha, not a man at all A Hound
thoros	So good to see you again, Clegane
sandor	Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
thoros	Drinking and talking too much Same as ever
thoros	A pretty prize, lads
men	Yeah
sandor	Girl
sandor	What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
jaime	Its a tough decision-take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water
brienne	Silence, Kingslayer
jaime	Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river
brienne	Good luck
jaime	Its wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas Which will she choose?
jaime	Gambler at heart Wouldnt have guessed
brienne	Be quick about it
jaime	I need to rest
brienne	Get up
jaime	I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far What do you call them?
brienne	Get up now
jaime	Corns I never used to get corns Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year
jaime	This heel is ruined Theres no way
jaime	I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords
jaime	Ooh You move well for a great beast of a woman
jaime	You shouldnt grimace before you lunge It gives away the game
jaime	Bit of a quandary for you If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark But if you dont kill me, Im going to kill you
jaime	Youre good Graceless, but good
jaime	See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there
locke	Looks like your womans getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman
jaime	We enjoy a good fight Gets our juices flowing The Flayed Man of House Bolton A bit gruesome for my taste
locke	You sure hes the one?
man	Thats him, all right I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Freys wedding
locke	Give the man his silver
jaime	Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want
edmure	If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-
brynden	Why dont you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And dont call him nephew He is your king
edmure	Robb knows I meant him no disr-
brynden	Youre lucky Im not your king I wouldnt let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag
edmure	My blunder sent Tywins mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs I think King Robb understands were not gonna win this war if hes the only one winning any battles No, theres glory enough to go around
robb	Its not about glory Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you
edmure	I seized an opportunity
robb	What value was the mill?
edmure	The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it
robb	Is he there now? Of course not
edmure	We took the fight to him He could not withstand us
robb	I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head I could have that head on a spike by now Instead, I have a mill
edmure	We took hostages Willem Lannister Martyn Lannister
robb	Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old
brynden	Martyn is 15, I believe
robb	Tywin Lannister has my sisters Have I sued for peace?
edmure	No
robb	Do you think hell sue for peace because we have his fathers brothers great-grandsons?
edmure	No
robb	How many men did you lose?
edmure	But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-
robb	We need our men more than Tywin needs his
edmure	Im sorry I didnt know
robb	You would have Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient
brynden	We seem to be running short of patience here
robb	You know who isnt? Tywin Lannister TYWIN stands by the head of the table PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER enter silently enters next TYWIN sits, then PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER join him remains still, while CERSEI enters and surveys the room She pauses, then walks to the table She picks up one of the two remaining empty chairs and places it directly next to TYWIN, then sits while the others smirk comes forward, and drags the final chair noisily to the opposite head of the table
tyrion	Intimate Lovely table Better chairs than the old small council chamber Conveniently close to your own quarters I like it
tywin	What news of Jaime?
tywin	20,000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?
varys	We are trying, my lord
tywin	Try harder What do we have, then?
varys	Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully In Starks absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name
tywin	Well, let him have it The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn
littlefinger	For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children She has always been positively predisposed toward me
pycelle	A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale
littlefinger	Titles do seem to breed titles
tywin	Youll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him
tyrion	Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelishs absence would present certain problems The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead Not a good time to leave the crowns finances unattended
tywin	Fully agreed Which is why Im naming you new Master of Coin
tyrion	Master of Coin?
tywin	It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents
tyrion	Im quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasnt taught me much about managing it
cersei	I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge
pycelle	Hear, hear
men	He lifted her high in the air He sniffed and roared and smelled her there She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair But he licked the honey from her hair From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered with hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear and the maiden fair
jaime	I hope youre pleased If you had armed me, they never would have taken us
brienne	You were armed when we were taken
jaime	I was in chains if you recall Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands werent bound
brienne	All my life Ive been hearing, Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman You were slower than I expected And more predictable
jaime	Ive been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year
brienne	And Im a woman I was still beating you
jaime	You were not beating me
brienne	Maybe you were as good as people said once Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name
jaime	When we make camp tonight, youll be raped More than once None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman Youd be wise not to resist
brienne	Would I?
jaime	Theyll knock your teeth out
brienne	You think I care about my teeth?
jaime	No, I dont think you care about your teeth If you fight them, they will kill you Do you understand? Im the prisoner of value, not you Let them have what they want What does it matter?
brienne	What does it matter?
jaime	Close your eyes Pretend theyre Renly
brienne	If you were a woman, you wouldnt resist? Youd let them do what they wanted?
jaime	If I was a woman, Id make them kill me But Im not, thank the gods
gendry	If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new
thoros	Doesnt have to look pretty It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart
arya	Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now hes our friend?
thoros	Youre not our prisoner, little lady
arya	What am I?
thoros	Our guest No ones put any chains on you
arya	So I can walk away, then?
thoros	These woods arent safe for Ned Starks daughter oure lucky we found you
sandor	You think youre good with that bow, you little twat?
anguy	Better than anyone youve ever met
sandor	A cowards weapon I like to fight up close I like to see a mans face when I put the steel in him
anguy	Why? So you can kiss him?
arya	You remember the last time you were here?
sandor	Looks like every other shit inn on the road
anguy	Now, apologies, but youre one ugly fucker and Id rather not see you no more
anguy	Watch your head Off we go
driver	Walk up
arya	What are you doing? Were about to leave
hot pie	Im staying
gendry	Youre what?
hot pie	I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better Told Thoros shes keeping me as a payment for all the free meals shes given him Anyway, its not me the Brotherhood wants My brother aint no king Im not a Stark of Winterhell
arya	Winterfell
hot pie	You sure?
arya	Im sure
hot pie	Well, I made you something
arya	What is it?
hot pie	Its a wolf
gendry	Yes, it is
arya	Thats the tail?
hot pie	Yeah
gendry	Well, be safe
hot pie	Yeah, you, too Dont get stabbed
gendry	You dont burn your fingers
arya	Good-bye, Hot Pie
hot pie	Good-bye, Arry
man	Up you go, little lady
arya	Hey, Hot Pie Its really good
catelyn	A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting were at war
brynden	It often comforts me to think that even in wars darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening
catelyn	Ive missed you, Uncle Father missed you, too, from the day you left Maybe he never said it in so many words-
brynden	Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox I was surprised when he died Didnt think death had the patience
catelyn	Im glad you were with him I wish to the gods I had been Did you make peace in the end?
brynden	After 30 years of fighting, I dont think he remembered what started it He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they dont remember my real name
catelyn	Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, Id see him off Wait for me, little Cat, hed say Wait for me and Ill come back to you And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return I will never see them again
brynden	You mustnt think it We dont know the truth They could be in hiding Robb believes theyre alive And he must go on believing Hes got to remain strong if hes to prevail And you must remain strong for him
martyn	Youre Robb Starks wife
talisa	Hold still
martyn	Is it true what they say about him?
talisa	I dont know What do they say about him?
martyn	That he can turn into a wolf at night
talisa	True
martyn	And he eats the flesh of his enemies
talisa	True Youre a Lannister, arent you?
martyn	Martyn Lannister
talisa	Martyn Lannister Youve nothing to fear My husband doesnt eat children Unless its a full moon Its not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear
mance	Always the artists
jon	Its only horses No men
ygritte	You said there was dead crows
orell	There was
mance	How many men were here?
jon	About 300
mance	And you know what those men are now?
mance	Were all the same to them meat for their army
jon	Do you think anyone got away?
mance	Its not impossible You dont go far betting against Mormont But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north And he lost His best fighting men are dead And whether hes Lord Commander of the Nights Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, hes a long way from home Tormund Climb the Wall Take Orell and 20 good men And take this one He knows Castle Blacks defenses better than any of us And if hes useful, good If not throw him off the Wall See if crows can fly
tormund	Were finally going to war, old friend?
mance	Hide near Castle Black When I give the signal, hit them in the night Theyve got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side
tormund	Well meet again
mance	Aye If you do your job Ah
orell	How will we see your signal?
mance	Send your eagle above the Wall every night When its time, Im going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen
sam	Ghost?
craster	What have we here? Frozen crows?
jeor	Weve come a long way
craster	Smaller flock than you went north with
jeor	We can talk inside
craster	Oh, can we?
woman	They need some water
woman	Tether it and Ill be inside
craster	Keep your eyes where they belong Theyre not for you
karl tanner	Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us
craster	Aye, pigs got value to me You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in Id have turned you all away if I wasnt a godly man
jeor	You are a godly man?
craster	I am I got no fear of whats out there When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires wont help you The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods The real gods
craster	Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist Women That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight Barely a grunt And shes almost as fat as this one here Now why dont you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go Well, look at him Hes a walking feast
woman	Here we are
woman	Sharpen these for me, would ya?
woman	I see the head Push
woman	Thats it Youre nearly there One more push should do it
gilly	What is it? What is it?
ramsay	Keep quiet
ramsey	If you cant ride, we dont stand a chance
theon	I can ride

ramsay	Ride east Follow the rising sun Your sisters waiting for you

stannis	You refuse to tell me where youre going?
melisandre	I dont know yet The fires will show me
stannis	How long will you be gone?
melisandre	I dont know
stannis	Youre abandoning me
melisandre	I will never abandon you You are the Son of Fire I am sworn to serve you
stannis	Then serve me
melisandre	When I return, you will understand
stannis	My enemies think theyve destroyed me Theyre laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me I want Joffrey dead I want Robb Stark dead Make me another son
melisandre	I cannot
stannis	Why?
melisandre	You dont have the strength It would kill you
stannis	Im not so easily killed Men have been trying for years
stannis	I want you
melisandre	Your fires burn low, my king
melisandre	There is another way A better way
stannis	You told me your magic requires a kings blood
melisandre	Yes
stannis	Im the one true king
melisandre	You are But there are others with your blood in their veins You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices The Lord of Light demands it
barristan	The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace
daenerys	To whom?
barristan	To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did
daenerys	Give me your water
jorah	Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death
daenerys	Here, drink
barristan	Leave this place, Your Grace Leave tonight, I beg you
jorah	And what is she to do for soldiers?
barristan	We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr
jorah	Is it we already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done
daenerys	The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents
jorah	How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?
barristan	Three
jorah	Have you ever seen a war where innocents didnt die by the thousands?
jorah	I was in Kings Landing after the sack, khaleesi You know what I saw? Butchery Babies, children, old men More women raped than you can count Theres a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand But the Unsullied are not men They do not rape They do not put cities to the sword unless theyre ordered to do so If you buy them, the only men theyll kill are those you want dead
daenerys	Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?
barristan	When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because theyd been bought at a slavers auction I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace I bled beside him
jorah	Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died
daenerys	Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?
barristan	I did, Your Grace Finest man I ever met
daenerys	I wish I had known him But he was not the last dragon
missandei	All? Did this ones ears mishear, Your Grace?
daenerys	They did not I want to buy them all
missandei	She wants to buy them all
kraznys	She cant afford them The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants
missandei	There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor Is this what you mean by all?
daenerys	Yes 8,000 And the ones still in training as well
greizhen	If they fail on the battlefield, they will shape Astapor
missandei	Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor
daenerys	I will have them all or take none Many will fall in battle Ill need the boys to pick up the swords they drop
kraznys	The slut cannot pay for all of this
missandei	Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this
kraznys	Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied, no more
missandei	Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous
kraznys	And this is because I like the curve of her ass
missandei	The gold you have left is worth 10
kraznys	What is left will buy her 10 I will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering
missandei	But good Master Kraznys will give you 20
kraznys	Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed
missandei	The Dothraki you have with you-
kraznys	I will give her 3 for those
missandei	The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them
kraznys	So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?
missandei	Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied
daenerys	I have dragons Ill give you one
barristan	You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace
jorah	Khaleesi, please
kraznys	Three dragons
daenerys	One
kraznys	Two
daenerys	One
missandei	They want the biggest one
daenerys	Done
kraznys	Done
daenerys	Ill take you as well, now Youll be Master Kraznys gift to me A token of a bargain well struck
missandei	She asks that you give me to her, as a present She asks that you do this now
jorah	Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army
barristan	Aegon Targaryen proved that
daenerys	Youre both here to advise me I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, youll be advising someone else Is that understood?
daenerys	Do you have a name?
missandei	This ones name is Missandei, Your Grace
daenerys	Do you have a family? A mother and a father youd return to if you had the choice?
missandei	No, Your Grace No family living
daenerys	You belong to me now It is your duty to tell me the truth
missandei	Yes, Your Grace Lying is a great offense Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less
daenerys	I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment Do you know what he said to me? Let me die
missandei	There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace
daenerys	Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
missandei	All questions have been taken from them They obey, that is all Once they are yours, they are yours They will fall on their swords if you command it
daenerys	And what about you? You know that Im taking you to war You may go hungry You may fall sick You may be killed
missandei	Valar morghulis
daenerys	Yes, all men must die But we are not men
tyrion	A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers
littlefinger	Im surprised youre surprised This is the safest place in the city
tyrion	Not for bastards
ros	Thats all of them, my lord
littlefinger	Thank you, my dear
tyrion	Pod Pod Take them outside Ill be there in a moment
podrick	Yes, my lord
littlefinger	I hear you owe that boy a significant debt
tyrion	Only my life Not all that significant, Im afraid
littlefinger	You should have him knighted
tyrion	If only the Master of Coin had such power
littlefinger	If only I owe you a significant debt Our redheaded friend You secured her release when the queen detained her
tyrion	Oh, that Of course A simple misunderstanding
littlefinger	Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship
tyrion	We dont I did fuck her once
littlefinger	I know
tyrion	But we dont
littlefinger	I know But how would the queen get that idea?
tyrion	Why dont you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
littlefinger	Keep a low profile
tyrion	If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, Id be richer than you are
littlefinger	Well, you are richer than I am
tyrion	Good point
littlefinger	Theyre only numbers Numbers on paper Once you understand that, its easy to make them behave Trivial even You want a real challenge? Try whores
tyrion	Ive tried quite a few Well, lots of work to do Enjoy the Eyrie
bronn	Come on, Im here later Come on
bronn	Tonight, then Looks like dull reading
tyrion	You think all reading is dull reading
bronn	Its an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know
tyrion	The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages
bronn	Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what hes really up to
tyrion	Unless he made it all up, yes Podrick, do keep up
podrick	Yes, my lord
tyrion	Podrick
podrick	Yes, my lord?
tyrion	After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services youve provided over and above what might be considered reasonable Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?
podrick	No, my lord
tyrion	Wonderful Genna specializes in first-timers
bronn	Shes not bad with second-timers, either
podrick	Uh
tyrion	A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killers face, wouldnt you say?
tyrion	Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself Shes here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me
marei	Hes handsome You didnt tell me he was handsome
tyrion	Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot
podrick	My lord
tyrion	Shes here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow whos never once failed to address me as my lord
tyrion	Be back in time for my supper
bronn	Pace yourself, lad
tyrion	For years Ive heard that Littlefinger is a magician Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold
bronn	Let me guess Hes not a magician
tyrion	No
bronn	Hes stealing it?
tyrion	Worse, hes borrowing it
bronn	Whats wrong with that?
tyrion	We cant afford to pay it back, thats whats wrong with it The crown owes millions to my father
bronn	Seeing as its his grandsons ass on the throne, I imagine hell forgive that debt
tyrion	Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, youre strangely naive
bronn	Ive never borrowed money before Im not clear on the rules
tyrion	Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest
bronn	And what if I dont?
tyrion	Well, you have to
bronn	But what if I dont?
tyrion	This is why I dont lend you money Anyway, its not my father Im worried about Its the Iron Bank of Braavos We owe them tens of millions If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies One way or another, they always get their gold back
tyrion	Ah, the return of the conquering hero Does he have a little jaunt in his step?
bronn	The lads practically skipping
tyrion	You were gone a long time I trust you got your moneys worth Or should I say my moneys worth?
tyrion	Oh, it was a gift, Podrick This is more than I give you in a year
bronn	Hes a squire You dont pay him
tyrion	Oh, then its much more than I give you in a year
podrick	They wouldnt take it, my lord
bronn	Maybe theyre trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin
tyrion	Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them
bronn	What did you tell them?
podrick	I didnt tell them anything
tyrion	What did you do to them?
podrick	Lots of things
tyrion	And they seemed to like these things?
podrick	Yes, my lord
bronn	Of course they seemed to like it Theyre paid to seem to like it
tyrion	Only they werent paid
bronn	What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?
tyrion	Is that what youre telling us? {PODRICK doesnt deny it
tyrion	Sit down, Podrick
tyrion	Were going to need details Copious details
theon	Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on
soldier	Ha! Ha

locke	Aye, you have both
jaime	Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding
locke	Hard to argue with that
jaime	Now that were speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree Im not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it Im not as young and resilient as I was once

man	Come on, you
varys	Oh, Lord Tyrion Come in, come in
tyrion	I hope we might speak In confidence
varys	Oh, always in confidence
tyrion	About the events of the Blackwater Perhaps this is the wrong time?
varys	Oh, no Its a wonderful time
tyrion	I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sisters intentions to-
varys	End your life?
tyrion	I didnt inherit Littlefingers spies along with his position, Im afraid Which is why Im coming to you I need proof
varys	Proof? Will there be a trial?
tyrion	I need to know
varys	I have no proof, only whispers Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut Do you want to hear it still?
tyrion	I dont know Do I?
varys	As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse I feared the man meant to use me as Id heard some men used small boys But what he wanted was far worse He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while He burned my parts in a brazier The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call I still dream of that night Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade I dream of the voice from the flames Was it a god? A demon? A conjurors trick? I dont know But the sorcerer called and a voice answered And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess A symbolic revenge of sorts
tyrion	Yes, ahem I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed Which will require a degree of influence, which-
varys	You do not possess at the moment
varys	But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found Once I had served the sorcerers purpose, he threw me out of his house to die I resolved to live to spite him I begged I sold what parts of my body remained to me I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a mans letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber Influence grows like a weed I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special
tyrion	The sorcerer
varys	Hello, my old friend Its been a long time I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it
grenn	When people talk about the Nights Watch, they never mention the shoveling
eddison	Or the shit
grenn	They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it
eddison	And getting attacked or killed or worse And that
grenn	But when youre not getting attacked or killed, usually youre shoveling
eddison	Oh, look More shit I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day
rast	We need to get out of here
grenn	When the Lord Commander says we go, we go
rast	The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men Howd that turn out for us?
eddison	He had no way of knowing
rast	We do now We know whats out there
grenn	Crasters been out here surviving
rast	So hes your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
eddison	Were like the sons he never had
rast	Mormont isnt gonna save you This lummox here isnt gonna save you When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs If we want to live well have to look out for ourselves
gilly	Shh, shh, shh
gilly	You woke him
sam	Im sorry Hes beautiful
gilly	Shh
sam	Hes beautiful Does he have a name?
gilly	No
sam	Are you going to give him one?

sam	I wanted you to have it
gilly	I dont want your stupid thimble I want to save my babys life Can you do that? Can you?
gilly	I dont have time for you I dont have time for anyone but him because he doesnt have much time
jojen	You have to go after him

catelyn	Promise me Promise me! Promise me
bran	Mother! Mother
catelyn	Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me
varys	Is he very large?
ros	No larger than usual, apparently And yet they said that he was-
varys	Extraordinary
ros	The most extraordinary man theyve ever had And theyve had a lot of men
varys	Were talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrions service? Seems a bit simple?
varys	What did he do to them?
ros	I dont know, my lord The girls are usually quite descriptive
varys	So what did they say?
ros	They said it was hard to describe
varys	Huh Prodigies appear in the oddest of places And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
ros	He was too preoccupied to notice Hes leaving for the Eyrie soon Im helping him prepare for his journey
varys	Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her Sad, really Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
ros	He hasnt spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know But I dont think hes lost interest
varys	What makes you say so?
ros	His shipboard inventory
varys	Ah You can read Rare for a woman in your profession
ros	Former profession
varys	Of course Im missing something obvious youre about to point out?
ros	Two featherbeds Hes bringing two featherbeds for the cabin
varys	Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
ros	Hes not interested in them, my lord
varys	How do you know?
ros	Because Im one of his girls
varys	Prodigies in odd places indeed
joffrey	Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon It ate her while her son watched Whats left of her is buried in the crypts right down there
cersei	The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably
olenna	There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else
cersei	There arent more than 700 people of any importance
olenna	No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats
joffrey	Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen Aerion Brightflame they called him He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon
joffrey	He was wrong And, of course, theres the Mad King, killed by my uncle Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
cersei	Are you sure Lady Margaery doesnt find all this a bit macabre?
margaery	Oh, no, its quite all right, Your Grace Id love to see their tombs, really Its like taking a walk through history
joffrey	The tombs just up here
margaery	This is so exciting
olenna	You were married here, Your Grace?
cersei	Yes
olenna	Must seem like only yesterday
cersei	Seems like a lifetime ago
olenna	Your husband, was he buried here as well?
cersei	No, he wanted his remains returned to Storms End
olenna	Such a tragedy
cersei	A fairly predictable tragedy Hunting and drinking dont mix
olenna	I should say not My sons a hunter It helps him forget hes never been within a mile of a real battle
cersei	I seem to recall he laid siege to Storms End for the better part of a year
olenna	All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent
olenna	I told him to stay out of Roberts rebellion He had no business fighting an actual warrior We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave But they do seem to yearn for it We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing
cersei	And yet the world belongs to them
olenna	A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind
cersei	The gods have seen fit to make it so
joffrey	My father didnt want them here He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise
margaery	Im glad he did Im sorry, Your Grace I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness
joffrey	I couldnt agree more
margaery	Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold Ive spoken with them I know how they feel about you You led the defense of Kings Landing They adore you
joffrey	Open the doors
cersei	Joffrey Wait
woman	Lady Margaery
woman	Lady Margaery
woman	Bless you, Lady Margaery
woman	Lady Margaery
woman	Lady Margaery
woman	Margaery
woman	Long live Lady Margaery
man	King Joffrey
woman	King Joffrey
woman	King Joffrey
man	King Joffrey
man	Gods bless King Joffrey
theon	How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
ramsay	Not far, my lord Your sister is waiting for you there
theon	She sent you to save me?
ramsay	Yes I served them, the men who were torturing you I did what they told me and waited for the right moment
theon	Why would you risk your life for me?
ramsay	I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord I was only a boy when they took you away My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off I remember the look on my fathers face when he told us, Thats Balon Greyjoys last living son And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you
theon	Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me Did he?
ramsay	I I dont know, my lord They they never told me much
theon	My sisters men are loyal to her We dont need to hide from them
ramsay	Not all those are your sisters men Some of them are loyal to your father
ramsay	What is it?
theon	I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place
ramsay	What did he tell you to do?
theon	Raid fishing villages He didnt trust me Thought I was a Stark Ha I could never be a Stark Robb Stark always reminded me of that
ramsay	He lorded it over you?
theon	Didnt have to All he had to do was be Be who he was born to be His life fit him better than his clothes How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? Hes the King in the North
theon	And me my father gave me a choice and I made it I could never be a Stark But ironborn, thats what I was born to be I paid the iron price for Winterfell I murdered those boys
ramsay	The Stark boys?
theon	Never found them Just some poor orphans living with a farmer I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud
ramsay	Maybe its not too late
theon	It is My real father lost his head at Kings Landing I made a choice and I chose wrong And now Ive burned everything down
ramsay	Not everything, my lord Shes up here
theon	Yara
ramsay	Shh Wait
ramsay	I brought him back He killed the others
theon	What? No, I didnt
theon	You cant! No, please stop! No
ramsay	Put him back where he belongs
brienne	Eat What are you doing?
jaime	Im dying
brienne	You cant die You need to live to take revenge
jaime	I dont care about revenge
brienne	You coward A little misfortune and youre giving up
jaime	Misfor misfortune?
brienne	You lost your hand
jaime	My sword hand I was that hand
brienne	You have a taste one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit You sound like a bloody woman
brienne	I know what you did for me You told them Tarth was full of sapphires Its called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water You knew that Why did you help me?
tywin	You wanted to speak to me?
cersei	Yes, about Jaime
tywin	What about him?
cersei	I wanted to make sure were doing everything we can to get him back
tywin	When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response?
cersei	You started a war
tywin	And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
cersei	Whatever you can
tywin	Whatever I can
tywin	Youre still here
cersei	Yes
tywin	Why?
cersei	Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me Years and years of lectures on family and legacy the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?
tywin	All right Contribute
cersei	The Tyrells are a problem
tywin	The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon The Tyrells saved your life, your childrens lives
cersei	Margaery has her claws in Joffrey She knows how to manipulate him
tywin	Good I wish you knew how to manipulate him I dont distrust you because youre a woman I distrust you because youre not as smart as you think you are Youve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city
cersei	Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes
tywin	I will
maid	Do you like it, Nana?
olenna	Another golden rose How original I eat from plates stamped with roses I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better Roses are boring, dear Growing strong Ha! The dullest words of any house Winter is coming! Now thats memorable We do not sow Strong Strong Those are houses you watch out for Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts But a golden rose growing strong ha, that strikes fear in the heart
olenna	Look, little loves A spider in the garden Run along now Grow strong
varys	My lady I wanted to personally welcome you to Kings Landing The city has been made brighter by your presence
olenna	The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?
varys	A little obvious, perhaps
olenna	Oh, no, please Seduce away Its been so long Though I rather think its all for naught What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers But youve come mincing all this way for something So?
varys	Might I sit?
olenna	No Come, Ive heard youre such a clever man Im curious why youve sought me out
varys	Youve taken an interest in Sansa Stark
olenna	Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldnt I take an interest? Shes an interesting girl
varys	Is she?
olenna	No, not particularly But shes had an interesting childhood
varys	She has, sadly Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being
olenna	Come, come You surrender rather easily Walk with me I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too
varys	I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still
olenna	Which is Sansa Stark?
varys	Neither A babe in the woods I admired her father
olenna	Yes Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
varys	I could not help Lord Stark Perhaps I can help his daughter
olenna	How?
varys	Youre not the only one who has taken an interest in her
olenna	Thats hardly surprising Shes a beautiful girl with a famous name
varys	Indeed Shed make a lovely match for the right suitor
olenna	It almost feels as if youre about to arrive at the point
varys	Littlefinger is not long for the capital A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him
olenna	And why have you come to me with this matter?
varys	Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies He has acquired the first two How long before he has the army?
varys	Perhaps youll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North
olenna	And if Littlefinger marries her, hell have the key in his pocket
varys	Which seems such a shame Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
olenna	You must despise him Youre working so hard to undermine him
varys	Actually, I rather enjoy him But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes
olenna	You are a clever man, Lord Varys
varys	You are too kind I believe I have a possible solution
olenna	One doesnt need to be clever for that Its all rather obvious, isnt it?
margaery	Ahem I didnt mean to disturb you
sansa	You havent
margaery	Wed like some privacy, please If you wouldnt mind waiting back inside the keep Or if youd be kind enough to give me your names, Ill ask the king to speak with you himself
margaery	What did you pray for?
sansa	I cant tell you
margaery	Why not? Ill tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning Lets see, for my familys health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter Boring and traditional, Im afraid And you?
sansa	Im sorry, I just cant
margaery	My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl Id ever seen When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me Pig-face, she called me
sansa	Pig-face? Thats ridiculous
margaery	I think it had something to do with my nose Whenever she passed me in the halls, shed oink
margaery	So I prayed that shed catch a horrible skin disease A week after that, she came down with porridge plague
sansa	Porridge plague?
margaery	You dont have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony
sansa	But thats awful
sansa	Youre I believed you! Porridge plague Im an idiot
margaery	Dont say that No, youre not
sansa	So what happened to Alanna?
margaery	Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea Its all terribly frustrating
sansa	Im sure shes jealous of you now Youll be married here in the capital and shell have to come watch and pretend to be happy that youre queen
margaery	I want us to be friends, good friends
sansa	That would make me very happy
margaery	You must see Highgarden Youd love it there I know you would We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon You should see the costumes People work on them for months
sansa	I I dont think the queen would let me leave Kings Landing
margaery	The Queen Regent, you mean Once I marry Joffrey, Ill be queen And if you were to marry Loras Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldnt it? We would be sisters, you and I Would you like that?
jeor	His name was Bannen He was a good man, a good ranger He came to us from where did he come from?

karl tanner	Id rather eat what youve got hidden away
jeor	I told you to wait outside
rast	Hes sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die
craster	I gave you crows enough Ive got to feed my women
rast	So you admit youve got a hidden larder, then? How elsed you make it through winter?

craster	Bastard? Out with you, you little thief And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies Ill chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard
karl tanner	You are a bastard A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard
jeor	The gods will curse us for this By all the laws-
karl tanner	There are no laws beyond the Wall Now show us where he hides the food or youll get the same as he did
jeor	Unhand her
jeor	I shall have your head for this
sam	Quickly Quickly
gilly	Whats happening? Im not going out there
sam	No, we have to go Now
gilly	Follow me I know the best way Come on
rast	Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! Ill be cutting your throat one of these nights

arya	Ugh
thoros	Not easy finding molasses in wartime
gendry	Id have some
thoros	Lets go home
gendry	What is this place?
thoros	Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling
sandor	You look like a bunch of swineherds
anguy	Some of us were swineherds And some of us tanners and masons That was before
sandor	Youre still swineherds and tanners and masons You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
beric	No Fighting in a war makes you a soldier
sandor	Beric Dondarrion? Youve seen better days
beric	And I wont see them again
sandor	Stark deserters Baratheon deserters You lot arent fighting in a war Youre running from it
beric	Last I heard, you were King Joffreys guard dog But here you are 1000 miles from home Which of us is running?
sandor	Untie these ropes and well find out What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
beric	Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Roberts name
sandor	Ned Stark is dead King Robert is dead My brothers alive
sandor	Youre fighting for ghosts
beric	Thats what we are ghosts waiting for you in the dark You cant see us, but we see you No matter whose cloak you wear Lannister, Stark, Baratheon you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down
sandor	You found god? Is that it?
beric	Aye Ive been reborn in the light of the one true god As have we all As would any man whos seen the things weve seen
sandor	If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it
thoros	Youll die soon enough, dog But it wont be murder, only justice
anguy	And a kinder fate than you deserve Lions you call yourselves At the Mummers Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched
sandor	I wasnt at the Mummers Ford Dump your dead children at some other door
thoros	House Clegane was built upon dead children I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne
sandor	Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
anguy	Murder is a crime
sandor	I never touched the Targaryen babes I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But dont call me murderer and pretend that youre not
arya	You murdered Mycah The butchers boy My friend He was 12 years old He was unarmed And you rode him down You slung him over your horse like he was some deer
sandor	Aye, he was a bleeder
beric	You dont deny killing this boy?
sandor	I was Joffreys sworn shield The boy attacked the prince
arya	Thats a lie! I hit Joffrey Mycah just ran away
sandor	Then I should have killed you Not my place to question princes
beric	You stand accused of murder But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you Only the Lord of Light may do that now I sentence you to trial by combat
sandor	So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?
beric	Aye She might be But its me youll fight
missandei	The master says they are untested He says you would be wise to blood them early There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price
missandei	And who knows? In 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn Thus all shall prosper
daenerys	Is it done, then? They belong to me?

ygritte	Hes no crow

cersei	Lord Baelish
littlefinger	Your Grace
cersei	I wonder if I might ask you for a favor
littlefinger	Of course, Your Grace
cersei	I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crowns best interests at heart
littlefinger	I see And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
cersei	My fathers a practical man He appreciates facts
littlefinger	Myself, I often find them a hindrance
cersei	And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know Hes almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who dont You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital
littlefinger	I shall do my best
cersei	Thank you And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
littlefinger	I assure you that it will
olenna	Gods, boy, thats enough Were not in a tavern
podrick	Pardon, my lady
olenna	No need to speak Are there any figs? Fetch some I always take figs midafternoon They help move the bowels To what do I owe this summons?
tyrion	Thank you for seeing me, my lady I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters
olenna	I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
tyrion	Its the royal wedding Im told you had a hand in planning it
olenna	Naturally
tyrion	Its shaping up to be a very involved affair The word extravagant has been used
olenna	What good is the word extravagant if it cant be used to describe a royal wedding?
tyrion	I understand that
olenna	Good
tyrion	But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown As of now, its a huge expense
olenna	And?
tyrion	And were at war, Lady Olenna
olenna	Oh, Id nearly forgotten
tyrion	Yes, and maintaining supply lines-
olenna	I cant think how it slipped my mind What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? 2,000 in support Provisions so this city might survive the winter A million bushels of wheat Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye 20,000 head of cattle 50,000 sheep You dont have to lecture me about wartime expenses Im quite familiar with them
tyrion	And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm
olenna	As is a royal wedding The people are hungry for more than just food They crave distractions And if we dont provide them, theyll create their own And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces A royal wedding is much safer Wouldnt you say?
tyrion	I would
olenna	And traditionally paid for by the royal family
olenna	I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper Where did you go for them, Volantis?
tyrion	My lady-
olenna	Oh, very well I wont have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part Well pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned Is that sufficient?
tyrion	Quite sufficient Thank you
olenna	Very good, then Thats settled Good day
tyrion	Give me that
arya	What are you doing?
gendry	Just mending Lord Berics armor
arya	Why?
gendry	Im going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood
arya	Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think theyll spare the smiths? Theyll cave your head in with your own helmet
gendry	The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood
arya	You dont have to do this
gendry	I want to They need good men
arya	Robb needs good men, too Were leaving tomorrow And then you-
gendry	What? Serve him? Ive served men my entire life I served Master Mott at Kings Landing and he sold me to the Watch I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if Id get tortured or killed Im done serving
arya	You just said you were serving Lord Beric
gendry	He may be their leader, but they chose him These men are brothers Theyre a family Ive never had a family
arya	I can be your family
gendry	You wouldnt be my family Youd be my lady
martyn	Willem Willem
willem	Is this a rescue?
rickard kar	Lannister filth! Take him! MARTYN Please, I didnt do anything Im just a squire Please-
robb	Bring them in
robb	Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
rickard kar	Not murder, Your Grace Vengeance
robb	Vengeance? Those boys didnt kill your sons I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
rickard kar	Was strangled by the Kingslayer They were his kin
robb	They were boys! Look at them
rickard kar	Tell your mother to look at them She killed them as much as I
robb	My mother had nothing to do with this This was your treason
rickard kar	Its treason to free your enemies In war, you kill your enemies Did your father not teach you that, boy?
robb	Leave him
rickard kar	Aye Leave me to the king He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free Thats how he deals with treason Our King in the North Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
robb	Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon Hang the rest
man	Mercy, sire! I didnt kill anyone I only watched for the guards
robb	This one was only the watcher Hang him last so he can watch the others die
man	Please! Please, no They made me do it! They made me! They made me
edmure	Word of this cant leave Riverrun They were Tywin Lannisters nephews The Lannisters pay their debts They never stop talking about it
robb	Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
edmure	It wouldnt be lying We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done
robb	Im not fighting for justice if I dont serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn He has to die
catelyn	arstarks are Northmen They wont forgive the killing of their lord
talisa	Your mothers right If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you
robb	You tended to their wounds You brought them supper Now theyre dead
talisa	And more boys will keep dying until this war is over You need Karstark men to end it
catelyn	Spare his life Keep him as a hostage
edmure	A hostage Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed
rickard kar	The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy I fought the Mad King for your father I fought Joffrey for you We are kin Stark and Karstark
robb	That didnt stop you from betraying me And it wont save you now
rickard kar	I dont want it to save me I want it to haunt you to the end of your days
robb	Kneel, my lord
robb	Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die Would you speak a final word?
rickard kar	Kill me and be cursed You are no king of mine
arya	Joffrey Cersei Ilyn Payne The Hound What are you going to do with me?
thoros	At first light well ride for Riverrun Your brothers there now Hell make a contribution to our cause and you can go home
arya	Im a hostage and youre selling me
thoros	Dont think of it that way
arya	But it is that way
thoros	It is And it isnt
arya	More is than isnt
thoros	Beric admired your father a great deal, you know He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether
arya	So why dont you?
thoros	We need the gold
beric	Do I frighten you, child?
arya	No
beric	Youre angry with me And I dont blame you But letting him go was the right thing I have more reason than most to want him hanged
arya	I thought he killed you
arya	But how?
beric	Thoros how many times have you brought me BACK?
thoros	Its the Lord of Light brings you back Im just the lucky drunk who says the words
beric	How many times?
thoros	Five, I think No, this makes six
beric	Six
thoros	There was the first time the Mountain Show her Lance right through the chest
beric	Then I was stabbed in the belly
thoros	Then it was an arrow in the back And that axe in the side
beric	Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
thoros	Both Fuckers couldnt decide
thoros	And the Hound makes six
beric	Second time Ive been killed by a Clegane
thoros	Youd think youd learn Its not getting any easier, you know
beric	I know Every time I come back, Im a bit less Pieces of you get chipped away
arya	Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times Just once
thoros	I dont think it works that way, child
beric	He was a good man, Ned Stark Hes at rest now, somewhere I would never wish my life upon him
arya	I would Youre alive
selyse	Lord, cast your light upon me Protect me in the darkness Burn away my sins Help me serve you Use me as you will For the night is dark and full of terrors

selyse	I know of your troubles, My king The Lady Melisandre has told me everything
stannis	Yes, of course
selyse	You mustnt despair Your claim is true You will be victorious

stannis	Ive wronged you I have shamed you
selyse	Youre doing gods work
stannis	You dont understand The Red Woman the Lady Melisandre-
selyse	I know, Stannis The Lady Melisandre has told me everything No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin When she told me, I wept with joy
selyse	Oh, my sweet boys Petyr, Tommard, Edric I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us She gave you a son I gave you nothing
stannis	Thats not true
selyse	So youve come to see her as well? There is no need You must keep away from such distractions
stannis	Shes my daughter I want to see her
selyse	You are a king You dont need my permission
shireen	Under the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh

shireen	The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh

shireen	He hasnt come to visit me He said hed bring me back a present from the capital
stannis	He wont be visiting, child
shireen	Why not? Hes my friend Look
shireen	He made this for me But dont tell Mother I have it Its a secret Mother doesnt like the Onion Knight
stannis	Ser Davos is a traitor Hes rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime Best forget him
jaime	Not so hard Youll scrub the skin off
brienne	What are you doing here?
jaime	I need a bath Help me out of these rags
jaime	Now get out
brienne	Theres another tub
jaime	This one suits me fine Dont worry Im not interested If I faint, pull me out I dont intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub
brienne	Why should I care how you die?
jaime	You swore a solemn vow, remember? Youre supposed to get me to Kings Landing in one piece Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him
jaime	That was unworthy Forgive me You protected me better than most-
brienne	Dont you mock me
jaime	Im apologizing Im sick of fighting Lets call a truce
brienne	You need trust to have a truce
jaime	I trust you
jaime	There it is Theres the look Ive seen it for 17 years on face after face You all despise me Kingslayer Oathbreaker A man without honor Youve heard of wildfire?
brienne	Of course
jaime	The Mad King was obsessed with it He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones He burned lords he didnt like He burned Hands who disobeyed him He burned anyone who was against him Before long, half the country was against him Aerys saw traitors everywhere So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom Under houses, stables, taverns Even beneath the Red Keep itself Finally, the day of reckoning came Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels I knew my father better than that Hes never been one to pick the losing side I told the Mad King as much I urged him to surrender peacefully But the king didnt listen to me He didnt listen to Varys who tried to warn him But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt You can trust the Lannisters, he said The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender He told me to bring him my fathers head Then he turned to his pyromancer Burn them all, he said Burn them in their homes Burn them in their beds Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?
jaime	First, I killed the pyromancer And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back Burn them all, he kept saying Burn them all I dont think he expected to die He he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash I slit his throat to make sure that didnt happen Thats where Ned Stark found me
brienne	If this is true why didnt you tell anyone? Why didnt you tell Lord Stark?
jaime	Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
brienne	Help! Help! ingslayer
jaime	Jaime My name is Jaime
shireen	Onion Knight Ser Onion Knight
davos	Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?
shireen	Shh, youll wake Bert
davos	Bert?
shireen	Hes the fat one Hes on guard duty tonight He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot
davos	Go back to your room Youre not supposed to be here If your father knew-
shireen	he said you Were a traitor Are you?
davos	I am, child I disobeyed my king, your father, and now Im paying the price
shireen	I dont care Youre my friend You must get bored down here I brought you something to read Its about Aegon and his dragons Aegon used to live here Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle
davos	Aye So they did
shireen	You can hide the book under your cloak Its a good one Ill bring you more
davos	Thank you, my lady Im sure its a fine book, but its wasted on me
shireen	Take it I have more
davos	My lady, I cant read the words
shireen	You cant?
shireen	Ill teach you Ill come when Berts on duty and teach you
davos	No No No
shireen	Its easy Itll be fun
davos	Go We cant
shireen	Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?
davos	I wouldnt know where to start
shireen	At the beginning This word is Aegon When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg And the title of the whole book is An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros
jorah	It was a bitch of a siege
barristan	Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?
jorah	The second Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his
barristan	Thoros of Myr Bloody madman Robert knighted you after the battle?
jorah	Proudest moment of my life One knee in the dust, the kings sword on my shoulder, listening to the words In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave All I could think of was how badly I had to piss
jorah	In full plate metal for 16 hours Never occurred to me till the fighting was over I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the kings boots
barristan	Robert would have laughed He was a good man, a great warrior And a terrible king I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings
jorah	You swore an oath
barristan	Yes And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if hes serving a drunk or a lunatic Just once in my life before its over, I want to know what its like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in Do you believe in her?
jorah	With all my heart
daenerys	These are the ones?
missandei	Yes, khaleesi The officers
daenerys	You did not choose this life But you are free men now And free men make their own choices Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
daenerys	Remove your helmet GREY
worm	This one has the honor
daenerys	What is your name?
grey worm	Grey Worm
daenerys	Grey Worm
missandei	All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat Names that remind them what they are vermin
daenerys	From this day forward you will choose your own names You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same Throw away your slave name Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other A name that gives you pride
grey worm	Grey Worm gives me pride It is a very lucky name The name this one was born with was cursed That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free
jorah	King Robert wanted her dead
barristan	Of course he wanted her dead Shes a Targaryen The last Targaryen
jorah	I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him
barristan	I didnt sit on the small council
jorah	No? Doesnt the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
barristan	Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Roberts friends during his rebellion
barristan	He didnt want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King Cant say I minded much I always hated the politics
jorah	Yeah, I imagine I would, too Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over
barristan	Mm-hmm
jorah	Still, shell have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms
barristan	Shell have good men around her to advise her, men with experience
jorah	Which men do you have in mind?
barristan	Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what Im about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years
jorah	It suffered for a reason I sold men into slavery
barristan	I dont know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home
jorah	Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Roberts assassins while you were still bowing to the man
barristan	We both want her to rule Am I wrong?
jorah	You only joined us a few days ago I cant speak to your intentions
barristan	If were truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride
jorah	Youre not Lord here Youre just another exile And I take my orders from the queen
talisa	Come to bed
robb	You were right
robb	arstarks are gone Almost half our forces Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel Nothing Only wait
talisa	Dont let him
robb	What can I do? Attack Kings Landing? Theres nothing hed like better Hed crush us in a day
talisa	We could ride north Take your land back from the Greyjoys Wait out the winter
robb	Winter could last five years Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, theyll never ride south again When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission Now were like a band of bickering children
talisa	Give them a new purpose
robb	What?
talisa	Oh, I dont know I dont even know where Winterfell is
robb	Here And were here Kings Landing-
talisa	What is it?
robb	I cant force them to meet us in the field and I cant attack them where theyre strongest, but I can attack them where theyre not
robb	And Casterly Rock cant run away Im going to take their home away from them
talisa	Can you do it?
robb	I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasnt already sided with the Lannisters The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry Walder Frey
sansa	Hes such a splendid fighter Do you have any idea when we might
margaery	Ill plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married It should grow quickly
sansa	Joffrey wont let me leave Hes got too many reasons to keep me here
margaery	And only one to let you go Because it will please me
loras	Squire
olyvar	Well fought, ser
loras	That was no fight I dont know you
olyvar	Olyver, if it please you
olyvar	I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser
loras	How did you know?
olyvar	Know what?
loras	That I wanted to
loras	My lord Ill have you know Im to be married soon and even my intended hasnt the slightest notion
olyvar	They rarely do, in my experience
loras	You have a good deal of experience, do you?
olyvar	With the husbands
littlefinger	That didnt take long
olyvar	Well, it took long enough It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed
littlefinger	Is he? And whos the lucky girl?
littlefinger	She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but shes mine Ive always wanted a ship Now I want a dozen Strange, isnt it?
sansa	What is?
littlefinger	It doesnt matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else Your hair is different
sansa	Is it?
littlefinger	Lady Margaery wears it that way
sansa	Many ladies wear it this way
littlefinger	I have good news Ill be leaving the city soon
sansa	You still want me to come with you?
littlefinger	Its not a question of what I want Its what you want You want to go home, dont you?
sansa	Of course More than anything But maybe it would be better to wait Ive been thinking how dangerous it would be Not just for me, but for you Youve been so kind Id feel terrible if anything happened to you I cant tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare
littlefinger	I hope you know that Im your friend, Sansa Your true friend
sansa	I do, Lord Baelish
littlefinger	Petyr
sansa	Petyr
littlefinger	If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay
littlefinger	Well speak again when I return
tywin	Youre late
tyrion	Whats she doing here?
tywin	Our business concerns her, too Sit
tyrion	Youll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, Ive saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding
tywin	Never mind that now We have something important to discuss
tyrion	Im Master of Coin Saving money is important
tyrion	Stop that Youre making me uncomfortable
tywin	Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras
tyrion	Very well Shes a lovely girl Missing some of Loras favorite bits, but Im sure theyll make do
tywin	Your jokes are not appreciated
tyrion	It wasnt my best, but-
tywin	I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me
tyrion	Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother
tywin	arstarks have marched home The young wolf has lost half his army His days are numbered Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells
tyrion	The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war Do you really think its wise to refuse them?
tywin	Theres nothing to refuse This is a plot Plots are not public knowledge And the Tyrells wont carry this one out until after Joffreys wedding We need to act first and kill this union in its crib
tyrion	And how do we do that?
tywin	We find Sansa Stark a different husband
tyrion	Wonderful
cersei	Yes, it is
tyrion	You cant mean it
tywin	I can and I do
tyrion	Joffrey has made this poor girls life miserable since the day he took her fathers head Now shes finally free of him and you give her to me? Thats cruel even for you
tywin	Do you intend on mistreating her? The girls happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours
tyrion	Shes a child
cersei	Shes flowered, I assure you She and I have discussed it at length
tywin	There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her Surely youre capable of that
tyrion	And if I refuse?
tywin	You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for And it is past time you were wed
tyrion	I was wed Or dont you remember?
tywin	Only too well
cersei	You should be thanking the gods for this This is more than you deserve
tywin	Tyrion will do as hes bid As will you
cersei	What do you mean?
tywin	Youll marry Ser Loras
cersei	I will not
tywin	The boy is heir to Highgarden Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach
cersei	No, I wont do it
tywin	Yes, you will Youre still fertile You need to marry again and breed
cersei	I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare
tywin	Youre my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all
cersei	Father, dont make me do it again, please
tywin	Not another word My children Youve disgraced the Lannister name for far too long
gilly	Youve got too much wood in there
sam	But the more wood, the bigger the fire
gilly	It needs to breathe Take off that big log
sam	Huh You know your fires
gilly	Someone built your fires for you growing up?
sam	It doesnt get so cold down in the Reach And there were servants, of course
gilly	I knew you were highborn
sam	Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men Buried treasure Thousands of years old I think
gilly	What does it do?
sam	Im not sure that it does anything Its beautiful, though, isnt it?
gilly	How much longer?
sam	Not so far A few more days
gilly	Is the Wall as big as they say?
sam	Bigger So big you cant even see the top sometimes Its hidden in clouds
gilly	Youre playing with me
sam	Im not Its 700 feet high, all made of ice On a warm day you can see it weeping Castle Black is nice enough They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night And Hobb makes venison stew with onions Very tasty Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing Dareon sings best
gilly	Do you sing?
sam	No No, no, no Not very well
gilly	Sing me a song
sam	Oh, all right Lets see
sam	Oh ahem The fathers face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children
osha	Thats not how you skin a rabbit
meera	I know how to skin a rabbit
osha	Not by the looks of it
osha	You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game
meera	I didnt see any game before I got here
osha	If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits
meera	Well, I made this bow myself Guess you dont learn how to do that north of the Wall
osha	You learn how to use your fists, though
meera	Oh, youre gonna punch the rabbits to death?
osha	I had someone else in mind
meera	Well, someone else is sitting right here
bran	Youre both very good at skinning rabbits
osha	Some of us are just a little better
meera	Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them Or dont they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?
osha	Youve got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth
bran	Stop it
hodor	Hodor
bran	Youve been fighting since you met Just stop it
osha	Lady Reed heres got a stick so far up her ass, its a wonder her feet touch the ground
bran	Youve been nasty to her every day Of course shes nasty back
osha	Me? Its my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat
bran	First time I met you, you held a knife at me We cant fight each other Well never make it to the Wall I want you both to make peace
meera	Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine
osha	I said so, didnt I?
bran	Osha
osha	Youre a good little hunter
meera	Thank you See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you
osha	Dont push me
meera	Shh Im right here with you

meera	The visions take their toll
bran	Hes having one now?
jojen	I saw Jon Snow
bran	You saw him? At Castle Black?
jojen	He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies
tormund	Used to be you couldnt find a tree within a mile of the Wall Crows would come out every morning with axes
orell	Your flock gets smaller every year
jon	You ever climbed it before?
ygritte	No But Tormunds done it half a hundred times Youre afraid
jon	Arent you?
ygritte	Aye Its a long way up and a long way down But Ive waited my whole life to see the world from up there Here, sit down
ygritte	I brought a pair for you Theyre too big for you, but theyre good
jon	You kill someone for them?
ygritte	Nah I didnt kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised
ygritte	He wasnt good to me the way youre good to me He didnt do that thing you do with your tongue
jon	Can we not talk about that here?
ygritte	Can we not talk about that here? Im Jon Snow Ive killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but Im scared of naked girls
jon	Did I seem scared the other day?
ygritte	You were trembling like a leaf
jon	Only in the beginning
ygritte	Only in the beginning Youre a proper lover, Jon Snow And dont worry Your secrets safe with me
jon	What secret?
ygritte	Do you think Im as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? Youre loyal and youre brave You didnt stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayders tent
ygritte	But Im your woman now, Jon Snow Youre going to be loyal to your woman The Nights Watch dont care if you live or die Mance Rayder dont care if I live or die Were just soldiers in their armies and theres plenty more to carry on if we go down
ygritte	Its you and me that matters to me and you Dont ever betray me
jon	I wont
ygritte	Cause Ill cut your pretty cock right off and wear it round my neck
tormund	Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step And if you fall, dont scream You dont want that to be the last thing she remembers
arya	Joffrey Cersei Ilyn Payne
anguy	Youre good Youre not as good as you think you are
arya	Face, tits, balls I hit em right where I wanted to
anguy	Aye, but you took your sweet time of it You wont be fighting straw men, little lady Show me your position
anguy	Keep your elbow high You want your back doing the hard labor Youre holding Never hold
arya	What?
anguy	Your muscles tense up when you hold Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release Never hold
arya	But I have to aim
anguy	Never aim
arya	Never aim?
anguy	Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go Trust your eye
arya	Theres someone out there
anguy	Thats about far enough
melisandre	We come as friends
anguy	Begging your pardon, mlady, but well be the judge of that
melisandre	Valar morghulis
thoros	Valar dohaeris I dont see many priestesses of Rhollor in the Riverlands
melisandre	You are Thoros of Myr
melisandre	The High Priest gave you a mission Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light What happened?
thoros	I failed
melisandre	You quit, you mean The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk
thoros	You worship Him in your way, and Ill worship Him in mine Do you speak the common tongue?
thoros	My friends here dont speak High Valyrian Why are you here, my lady?
beric	Forgive my manners I dont see many ladies these days
thoros	Lucky for the ladies
melisandre	How many times has the Lord brought him back?
thoros	Six
melisandre	Thats not possible
thoros	The Lord has smiled upon me
melisandre	You should not have this power
thoros	I have no power I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will
thoros	Ive always been a terrible priest Drank too much rum Fucked all the whores in Kings Landing Its a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didnt believe in our Lord I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave So I wore the robes and every now and then Id recite the prayers, but it was just for show A spectacle for the locals Until the Mountain drove a lance through this ones heart I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead And they were the only words I knew And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied Berics eyes opened and I knew the truth Our god is the one true god And all men must serve Him
melisandre	Youve been to the other side
beric	The other side? There is no other side I have been to the darkness, my lady He sent you to us for a reason
melisandre	You have someone He needs
anguy	Bodkin point Penetrates plate at 200 yards Can you make em?
gendry	Yeah, nothing tricky about it Just need decent steel
anguy	Ill get you the steel
man	Come on
arya	I dont like that woman
anguy	Thats cause youre a girl
arya	What does that have to do with anything?
beric	Forgive me, lad
arya	What are you doing? Let go of him
arya	Tell them to stop Come on He wants to be one of you He wants to join the Brotherhood Stop them
beric	We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy
arya	Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
arya	Youre not doing this for your god Youre doing it for gold
thoros	Were doing it for both, girl We cant defend the people without weapons and horses and food And we cant get weapons and horses and food without gold
gendry	You told me this was a Brotherhood You told me I could be one of you
melisandre	You are more than they can ever be Theyre just foot soldiers in the great war You will make kings rise and fall
arya	Youre a witch Youre going to hurt him
melisandre	I see a darkness in you And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes Eyes youll shut forever We will meet again
ygritte	You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?
tormund	Look out
ygritte	You all right?
tormund	Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad
ramsay	Sorry Were you sleeping?
theon	Wa-
ramsay	Wa ? Wa ? Water? You want some water I wish I had some for you
ramsay	So lets play a game Which body part do you need the least?

theon	Ill tell you everything, please
ramsay	But youve already told me everything Remember? Your daddy was mean to you The Starks didnt appreciate you One good bit, though The Stark boys, theyre still alive Wouldnt that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but Im a better hunter than you

theon	Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off
ramsay	I win
robb	Thank you for riding here so quickly I know travel isnt easy in these times
black walder	The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits But when the King of the North summons us, we come
lothar	Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters
robb	Of course He deserves as much I was in the wrong
black walder	As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands
edmure	I dont think thats-
robb	We are fighting for the North Harrenhal is not in the North It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it
black walder	And theres something else
robb	We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs
black walder	Not what, whom
edmure	What?
edmure	No
lothar	Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters Roslin
edmure	How old is she?
edmure	Could I see her first?
black walder	You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end
brynden	Your father does realize were in the middle of a war?
lothar	Father is old It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband
black walder	And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements
robb	He has every right to be Please excuse us while we discuss it
edmure	Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were Im his liege lord
robb	Hes a proud man and weve wounded him
edmure	I didnt wound him My answer is no
brynden	Listen to me and listen very carefully You-
edmure	The laws of gods and men are very clear No man can compel another man to marry
brynden	The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth
robb	Its all right You heard him If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead
edmure	Hes wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12 Hes not gonna stop wanting it now When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing
catelyn	Youre willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
robb	I have a war to fight We cant win it without them I have no time to haggle You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill
brynden	You recall that heroic engagement?
edmure	I had something less permanent in mind
robb	Ive won every battle, but Im losing this war If we dont do this and do it now, were lost
edmure	Ill marry her
robb	Youre paying for my sins, Uncle Its not fair or right Ill remember it
roose bolton	I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear
brienne	Yes Most kind of them Youre a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton I am acting on Lady Starks orders to return Jaime Lannister to Kings Landing
roose bolton	When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner If she wasnt his mother, hed have hanged her for treason
roose bolton	I should send you back to Robb Stark
jaime	You should But instead, youre sitting here watching me fail at dinner Why might that be?
roose bolton	Wars cost money Many people would pay a great deal for you
jaime	We both know who would pay the most Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution
roose bolton	Youre right Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies
jaime	It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it
roose bolton	King Robb is keeping your father quite busy He doesnt have time for anything else
jaime	Hell make time for you
roose bolton	As soon as youre well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to Kings Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming
jaime	Shall we drink on it?
roose bolton	I dont partake
jaime	You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
jaime	Very well My lady, may our journey continue without further incident
roose bolton	Oh, she wont be going with you
brienne	I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
roose bolton	You are charged with abetting treason
jaime	Im afraid I must insist
roose bolton	Youre in no place to insist on anything I would have hoped youd learned your lesson about overplaying your position
olenna	Impossible
tywin	Why?
olenna	My grandson is the pride of Highgarden The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms Your daughter-
tywin	Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king
olenna	Old
tywin	Old?
olenna	Old Im something of an expert on the subject Her change will be upon her before long Ill spare you the details of what will happen then You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely
tywin	The years punish us as well, I promise you that My stomach remains quite strong, however The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandsons nocturnal activities Do you deny them?
olenna	Oh, not at all A sword swallower through and through
tywin	And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name
olenna	Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your fathers bannermen, squires, stable boys?
tywin	Of course
olenna	And you never-
tywin	No
olenna	Not once? Not in any way?
tywin	Never
olenna	I congratulate you upon your restraint But its a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets
tywin	Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior
olenna	I wouldnt say that True, we dont tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out
tywin	I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it
olenna	Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation
tywin	I dont care what people believe And neither do you
olenna	As an authority on myself, I must disagree
tywin	Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt
olenna	And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, were throwing another prized flower into the dirt It is a chance we simply cannot take
tywin	The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable All right Ill remove it for you
tywin	If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard Im sure youre familiar with the Kingsguard vows He will never marry He will never have children
tywin	The Tyrell name will fade And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery
olenna	You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
tywin	I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?
olenna	Its a rare enough thing a man who lives up to his reputation
orell	No
orell	Weve gotta cut them loose
tormund	No! They hang and dangle helplessly far from the wall, swinging back and forth ORELL continues to cut through the rope finally swings far enough to plant his axe in solid ice At the same moment, ORELL cuts through the rope and YGRITTE plummets, limbs spinning Her fall halts when the rope t goes taught
jon	Take my hand
sansa	Thats a wonderful pin
loras	Oh, its more of a brooch, really Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin
so sansa	Im very happy about
loras	Uh, yes I-I am as well
sansa	I feel like Im in a dream
loras	Yes, me, too Definitely Ive dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young The guests, the food, the tournaments And the bride, of course The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?
sansa	No I had never left Winterfell before I came to Kings Landing But it sounds wonderful I cant wait to see it And to leave this place
loras	Its terrible, isnt it? The most terrible place there is
tyrion	I dont suppose theres anything we can do about this
cersei	We can have them both killed
tyrion	Its hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement Probably Sansa Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery
cersei	Father doesnt discriminate Were all being shipped off to hell together
tyrion	On a boat you built
cersei	The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family I did what I did to protect our family
tyrion	Im your family A member of your family who has actively contributed to that familys survival Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it
cersei	I do admit it If it werent for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate
tyrion	Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you There are two people in Kings Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
tyrion	The impulse I understand He hates me because Im the only one who tells him what he really is So, fair enough He wants me dead But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army The boys an idiot
cersei	What do you want me to say?
tyrion	I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger
cersei	Probably But not from Joffrey He wont do anything now Fathers here
tyrion	Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister
cersei	Not the Tyrells Soon they wont need to be afraid of him Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore And so will his children and their children History will be taken from our hands
tyrion	You may escape, at least Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels
cersei	When Jaime gets back, yes But when do we think thats going to be? Hes out there somewhere
tyrion	Jaime or not, Im truly fucked
cersei	Whos going to tell her?
sansa	Do you think people will like it?
shae	I dont think they will even notice it
sansa	Youre right Its not my wedding Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in Kings Landing Theyd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding Loras likes green and gold brocade
shae	Im sure he does
sansa	Will they let me invite my family?
shae	They havent asked my opinion
sansa	But do you think they will?
shae	No
maid	Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you Should I-
tyrion	I beg your pardon, my lady
sansa	Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion I was just trying on a gown for King Joffreys wedding
tyrion	Yes, it should be quite a wedding I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa
sansa	Of course
tyrion	Alone, if I may
shae	Why do you need to speak to her alone?
sansa	Shae Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion Shes not from here But I trust her, even though she tells me not to
tyrion	Sometimes we think we want to hear something and its only afterwards when its too late that we realize we wished wed heard it under entirely different circumstances
sansa	Its all right, really
tyrion	How to begin? Its this this this is awkward
varys	1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegons fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread
littlefinger	There arent There arent even 200 Ive counted
varys	Ha, Im sure you have Ugly old thing Yet it has a certain appeal The Lysa Arryn of chairs Shame you had to settle for your second choice
littlefinger	Early days, my friend It is flattering, really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want
varys	Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you Although who doesnt like to see their friends fail now and then?
littlefinger	Youre so right For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells If Im going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didnt bring her any enjoyment And she didnt bring me any enjoyment She was a bad investment on my part Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new Something daring And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience
varys	I did what I did for the good of the realm
littlefinger	The realm? Do you know what the realm is? Its the thousand blades of Aegons enemies A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that its a lie
varys	But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all
littlefinger	Chaos isnt a pit Chaos is a ladder
littlefinger	Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again The fall breaks them
ygritte	How far are we?
jon	About a week, I think
ygritte	You think? You dont know?
jon	When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad
ygritte	You and your roads Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
jon	Most of the time, yes
ygritte	How do the men holding the banners fight?
jon	They dont, really Its a great honor to carry your house sigil
ygritte	And the drummers is that a great honor, too?
jon	Usually its the young boys banging the drums
ygritte	So what good are they?
jon	They help the men march
ygritte	How?
jon	Well, its its the rhythm
ygritte	Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we wont be banging on drums to let them know were coming
jon	No No, youre just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know youre coming
ygritte	You know nothing, Jon Snow
orell	Shes right, you dont
jon	I know you cut me loose on the Wall
orell	Cut her loose, too Do you see her sulking about it? Thats because she understands the way things are
jon	And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
orell	People work together when it suits them Theyre loyal when it suits them They love each other when it suits them And they kill each other when it suits them She knows that, you dont Which is why youll never hold onto her
brynden	That rain will cost us another day
robb	Frey will wait He knows were coming
catelyn	Lord Walder is prickly by nature
brynden	Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man Ive ever met
catelyn	Yes, and that is why-
brynden	Ive seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey Apologies, Your Grace Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen
talisa	Ive spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die Im not afraid of wet shits
catelyn	Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight
edmure	He can take it as he likes Hes getting the wedding he wanted
catelyn	Hes getting a wedding It was a king he wanted
robb	Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house We should all get some sleep
robb	If you dont put some clothes on, I cant promise I wont attack you again
talisa	Attack Attack
robb	Who are you writing?
talisa	My mother
robb	Is that Valyrian?
talisa	Gaaa
robb	Gaaa? Say hello for me
talisa	Rytsas
robb	Ritsas
talisa	That was close enough
robb	Does she know her daughters a queen?
talisa	Not yet
robb	That will be a surprise, I expect
talisa	Many surprises for her
robb	How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when youre over there looking like that?
talisa	Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
robb	I will
talisa	I promise I know shed love to meet you And her grandchild
robb	What, now? Are you certain?
talisa	Are you angry with me?
robb	Angry? Youre my queen
talisa	And I have your little prince or princess inside me
robb	Maybe one of each
talisa	Dont get greedy
talisa	Can you leave the war for one night?
robb	I love you Do you hear me? I love you
tormund	Most men fuck like dogs
tormund	No grace, no skill A few dozen thrusts and done You need to be patient Give her time Your cock shouldnt go near her till shes slick as a baby seal And then you go inside, but slowly Dont jam it in like youre spearing a pig Come on! Hey, come on
orell	You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? Hes gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?
ygritte	No, he didnt tell me anything He barely talks
orell	Ive seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls
ygritte	What, youre jealous?
orell	Of course Im jealous You should be with one of your own
ygritte	And youre one of my own? Ive never heard a kind word from your mouth
orell	You would if you were mine Id tell you that youre beautiful and fierce and wild Id be good to you You love him?
orell	Cause hes pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
ygritte	Dont touch me
orell	You wont love him so much when you find out what he really is
sansa	Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital See the southern knights and their painted armor and Kings Landing after dark all the candles burning in all those windows Im stupid A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns
margaery	Come on Come walk with me
margaery	I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room Id never seen anyone who looked so unhappy I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother
margaery	You would have been happy at Highgarden But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances
sansa	How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him
margaery	Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
sansa	No
margaery	Has he been kind to you?
sansa	Hes tried
margaery	You dont want him, though
sansa	Hes a Lannister
margaery	Far from the worst Lannister, wouldnt you say?
sansa	Im sorry Here I am complaining to you
margaery	My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers I plan to teach mine a great deal And your son, if Im not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday What?
sansa	My son with him Ill have to well have to-
margaery	If its the pain youre worried about-
sansa	Im not afraid of the pain Not after what Joffreys done to me
margaery	What is it, then? Hes rather good-looking even with the scar Especially with the scar
sansa	Hes a dwarf And Loras Loras
margaery	Some women like tall men Some like short men Some like hairy men Some like bald men Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls Most women dont know what they like until theyve tried it And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before were old and gray Tyrion may surprise you From what Ive heard, hes quite experienced
sansa	And thats a good thing?
margaery	It can be Were very complicated, you know Pleasing us takes practice
sansa	How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
margaery	Yes, sweet girl My mother taught me
tyrion	Shes a child
bronn	Shes a foot taller than you
tyrion	A tall child
bronn	Whats the youngest youve ever had?
tyrion	Not that young
bronn	How much older?
tyrion	Older
bronn	Youre a lord, shes a lady And a beauty at that I dont see the problem
tyrion	Shae isnt going to like it
bronn	Shae is a whore Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
tyrion	I should never have told you about that
bronn	You want Shae, keep her Wed one and bed the other All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl Hell be Lord of Winterfell one day You can rule the North in his name Youll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own
tyrion	Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them
bronn	You waste time trying to get people to love you, youll end up the most popular dead man in town You want to fuck that Stark girl You just dont want to admit it
tyrion	I dont pay you to put evil notions in my head The ones already there dont need company
bronn	You pay me to kill people who bother you Evil notions come free
tywin	Your Grace
joffrey	Grandfather
tywin	You wanted to speak to me?
joffrey	Yes Id like a report on the meetings of my small council
tywin	Youre welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace Any or all of them
joffrey	Ive been very busy Many important matters require a kings attention
tywin	Of course
joffrey	Youve been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber
tywin	I have, yes
joffrey	May I ask why?
tywin	The Tower of the Hand is where I work To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively
joffrey	So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?
tywin	We could arrange to have you carried
joffrey	Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons
tywin	Where did you hear about this?
joffrey	Is it true?
tywin	Apparently so
joffrey	Dont you think we ought to do something about it?
tywin	When I was Hand of the King under your fathers predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room The skull of the last of them was right here It was the size of an apple
joffrey	And the biggest was the size of a carriage
tywin	Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us
joffrey	But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
tywin	Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing
joffrey	But I havent been counseled
tywin	You are being counseled at this very moment
joffrey	I should be consulted about such things
tywin	From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary Your Grace
jorah	Yunkai The Yellow City
barristan	The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers We can defeat them
jorah	On the field, with ease But they wont meet us on the field They have provisions, patience, and strong walls If theyre wise, theyll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man
daenerys	I dont want half my army killed before Ive crossed the Narrow Sea
jorah	We dont need Yunkai, khaleesi Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne
daenerys	How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
jorah	200,000 if not more
daenerys	Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city
daenerys	Send a man to the city gates Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor
missandei	Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace
missandei	Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons
daenerys	You may approach Sit
missandei	Will the noble lord take refreshment?
kraznys mo nakloz	Ancient and glorious is Yunkai Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria Many an army has broken against our walls You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi
daenerys	Good My Unsullied need practice I was told to blood them early
radzal mo eraz	If blood is your desire, blood shall flow But why? Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people
radzal mo eraz	The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen
radzal mo eraz	There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship
daenerys	My ship?
radzal mo eraz	Yes, khaleesi As I said, we are a generous people You shall have as many ships as you require
daenerys	And what do you ask in return?
radzal mo eraz	All we ask is that you make use of these ships Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace
daenerys	I have a gift for you as well Your life
radzal mo eraz	My life?
daenerys	And the lives of your wise masters But I also want something in return You will release every slave in Yunkai Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy
radzal mo eraz	You are mad We are not Astapor or Qarth We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you Those who survive, we shall enslave once more Perhaps well make a slave of you as well
radzal mo eraz	You swore me safe conduct
daenerys	I did, but my dragons made no promises And you threatened their mother
radzal mo eraz	Take the gold
daenerys	My gold You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use Youd be wise to do the same with my gift to you Now get out
barristan	The Yunkish are a proud people They will not bend
daenerys	And what happens to things that dont bend? He said he had powerful friends Who was he talking about?
jorah	I dont know
daenerys	Find out
shae	Chains?
tyrion	Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport Smithed in Casterly Rock
shae	Golden chains
tyrion	You could buy a ship with these
shae	Do I need a ship?
tyrion	What?
shae	Am I going somewhere?
tyrion	Of course youre not going anywhere
shae	So, am I invited to your wedding?
tyrion	I didnt ask for this marriage I didnt want it
shae	No? Shes a beautiful girl You said so yourself
tyrion	That doesnt mean that this is duty, not desire
shae	Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
tyrion	I dont have a choice My father-
shae	Does not rule the world We can still go across the Narrow Sea
tyrion	What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock
shae	And Im Shae the funny whore
tyrion	My feelings for you have not changed I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her
shae	While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when youre bored?
tyrion	I swear to you it will not be like that
shae	No? What will it be like?
tyrion	I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants Any children we might have will be well provided for
shae	Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
tyrion	Listen Listen to me, my lady
shae	Im not your lady
tyrion	You are Youll always be my lady
shae	Im your whore And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing

sandor	Fuck Joffrey Fuck the queen Thats the Red Fork Im taking you to the Twins

barristan	Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty They cannot be trusted
jorah	They can be trusted to kill you if theyre well paid The Yunkish are paying them well
daenerys	You know these men?
jorah	Only by the broken swords on their banners Theyre called the Second Sons A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, The Titans Bastard
daenerys	Is he more titan or bastard?
jorah	Hes a dangerous man, khaleesi They all are
daenerys	How many?
barristan	2,000, Your Grace Armored and mounted
daenerys	Enough to make a difference?
daenerys	Its hard to collect wages from a corpse Im sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side
jorah	I imagine youre right
daenerys	Id like to talk to the Titans Bastard about winning
jorah	He may not agree to meet
daenerys	He will A man who fights for gold cant afford to lose to a girl
barristan	Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-
daario	Daario Naharis
mero	You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys
jorah	Mind your tongue
mero	Why? I didnt mind hers She licked my ass like she was born to do it
mero	You, slave girl, bring wine
daenerys	We have no slaves here
mero	Youll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you Take your clothes off and come and sit on Meros lap and I may give you my Second Sons
daenerys	Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?
barristan	Under 2,000, Your Grace
daenerys	We have more, dont we?
barristan	10,000 Unsullied
daenerys	Im only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us
daario	I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie You have 8,000 Unsullied
daenerys	Youre very young to be a captain
prendahl	Hes not a captain Hes a lieutenant
daenerys	Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds dont favor your side
mero	The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won
jorah	The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run
daenerys	Or you could fight for me
mero	Weve taken the slavers gold We fight for Yunkai
daenerys	I would pay you as much and more
prendahl	Our contract is our bond If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again
daenerys	Ride with me and youll never need another contract Youll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms
daario	You have no ships You have no siege weapons You have no cavalry
daenerys	A fortnight ago, I had no army A year ago, I had no dragons You have two days to decide
mero	Show me your cunt I want to see if its worth fighting for
grey worm	My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?
daenerys	These men are our guests You seem to be enjoying my wine Perhaps youd like a flagon to help you ponder
mero	Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
daenerys	A barrel, then
mero	Good The Titans Bastard does not drink alone In the Second Sons, we share everything After the battle, maybe well all share you
mero	Ill come looking for you when this is over
daenerys	Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first
barristan	Gladly, Your Grace

davos	Forgive me, Your Grace, Im not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew
stannis	What of it? Were at war Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
davos	Because he has your blood in his veins
stannis	So did Renly
davos	Renly wronged you Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you He raised an army, stole your bannermen This boy has done you no harm Hes an innocent
stannis	How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says The night that never ends Unless I triumph I never asked for this No more than I asked to be king We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty Whats one bastard boy against a kingdom?
davos	Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?
stannis	I came to free you If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again
davos	I swear it I cant swear never to speak against her
stannis	You have little regard for your own life
davos	Quite little, Your Grace Verging on none You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew Id counsel restraint You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself Youre not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory When my son was five he said to me, I dont ever want to die I wanted to say to him, You wont, child You wont ever I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night
stannis	I saw a vision in the flames A great battle in the snow I saw it And you saw whatever she gave birth to I never believed, but when you see the truth, when its right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?
prendahl	Little dragon bitch She talks too much
daario	You talk too much
mero	She wont talk so much when shes choking on my cock
daario	8000 unsullied stand between her and your cock
mero	My cock will find a way Tell him Is there any place that my cock cant reach?
daario	Shell tell me whatever you pay her to tell me
mero	Daario Naharis, the whore who doesnt like whores
daario	I like them very much I just refuse to pay them And Im no whore, my friend
mero	She sells her sheath and you sell your blade Whats the difference?
daario	I fight for beauty
prendahl	For beauty?
mero	We fight for gold
daario	The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you
mero	Youll die young
prendahl	What do we do about the dragon girl? We cant beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield
mero	There wont be a battle And we dont have to deal with her eunuchs We only have to deal with her
prendahl	Shes well guarded
mero	Tonights a new moon One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights
prendahl	Which one of us?
mero	Close your eyes, love
mero	Three coins A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos The Braavosi does the deed One for each of us, darling No peeking
daario	Do you hear me? Follow my voice Im right here
daario	You have something for me?
daario	Valar morghulis
tyrion	Lady Sansa
sansa	You look very handsome, my lord
tyrion	Oh, yes The husband of your dreams But you do look glorious Perhaps we could have a moment alone Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Starks handmaiden?
tyrion	My lady, I want you to know I didnt ask for this
sansa	I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord
tyrion	No, dont You dont have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore You wont be a prisoner after today Youll be my wife I suppose thats a different kind of prison I just wanted to say Im just trying to say very badly I just just want to say I know how you feel
sansa	I doubt that very much, my lord
tyrion	Youre right I have no idea how you feel And you have no idea how I feel
tyrion	But I promise you one thing, my lady I wont ever hurt you Do you drink wine?
sansa	When I have to
tyrion	Well, today you have to
margaery	You look radiant, Your Grace
cersei	Radiant? Why radiant?
margaery	Its the word that came to mind
margaery	Were going to be sisters soon We should be friends
cersei	Youre a musical girl, arent you? I imagine you have a lovely voice
margaery	A better dancer than a singer, Im afraid
cersei	Ah, but you know the song The Rains of Castamere?
margaery	Of course They play it so often here at court
cersei	So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
margaery	Not as well as you, Im sure
cersei	House Reyne was a powerful family Very wealthy The second wealthiest in Westeros Arent the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
cersei	Of course, ambitious climbers dont want to stop on the second highest rung If only you could take that final step, youd see further than all the rest Youd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore And finally one day, he rebelled against my father Do you know where House Reyne is now?
margaery	Gone
cersei	Gone A gentle word Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword
cersei	I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock My father let them rot up there all summer It was a long summer And now the rains weep oer their halls, and not a soul to hear
cersei	If you ever call me sister again, Ill have you strangled in your sleep
sansa	What are you doing?
joffrey	Your fathers gone As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband
high septon	You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
tyrion	Could you
tyrion	Thank you
high septon	Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever
melisandre	Have you ever seen one like it?
gendry	Ive never seen anything like any of this Not in my life
melisandre	Its shocking, isnt it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day And stew is a kind word for it
gendry	In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown Wed pretend that the meat in them was chicken We knew it wasnt chicken
melisandre	Here, taste this
melisandre	You think Im trying to poison you?
gendry	Thats good
gendry	Thats really good
melisandre	Where do you think its from?
gendry	I couldnt even guess
melisandre	Doesnt matter, does it? Its the real thing or its not You only need a tongue to tell the difference Go on, have some more You still dont trust it You think this is all a mistake and that youll have to pay somehow for every bite you take
gendry	That thought had crossed my mind, yeah
melisandre	There are no mistakes Not for us
gendry	Im a mistake Im only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern
melisandre	Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you cant even begin to understand And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world Were both a part of His plan He wants this for us No, He demands this of us
gendry	I dont understand This this doesnt seem very religious
melisandre	According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, whats their answer? A god is real or hes not You only need eyes to see
melisandre	Death is coming for everyone and everything A darkness that will swallow the dawn And we can stop it, you and I
melisandre	Let me show you what you have inside you Come fight death with me
gendry	What are you doing?
melisandre	You have to trust me
gendry	What ? Get it away Get it off me
melisandre	Dont fight, dont fight They wont take much
gendry	Why are you doing this?
melisandre	I told you theres power in the blood of kings And you have so much blood
gendry	No No, no, no, no! Not there Not there
melisandre	You can blame Ser Davos He didnt believe in the power of kings blood He wanted a demonstration
gendry	Please Please, Your Grace My lord
stannis	The usurper Robb Stark The usurper Balon Greyjoy The usurper Joffrey Baratheon JOFFREY and CERSEI sit amist the festivities drinking wine and chatting TYWIN sits to their left, stoic At the head table, TYRION carefully fills his wine glass right to the brim He smacks his lips and looks over to SANSA, who is disgusted with him The Tyrells sit across the hall from the Lannisters speaks with amusement to LORAS and MARGAERY
olenna	So their son will be your nephew After youre wed to Cersei, of course And you will be the kings stepfather and brother-in-law When you marry the king, Joffreys mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras nephew? Grandson? Im not sure But your brother will become your father-in-law That much is beyond dispute
sansa	Will you pardon me, my lord?
tyrion	Of course Of course En enjoy
cersei	Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead
joffrey	Ive got a lifetime for that
cersei	Stay
tywin	You seem rather drunk
tyrion	Rather less than I plan to be Isnt it a mans duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
tywin	This isnt about your wedding Renly Baratheon had a wedding Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible
tyrion	And?
tywin	If youre going to give her one, you need to perform
tyrion	What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast
tywin	More than once
tyrion	There you have it Nothing to worry about Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things I am the god of tits and wine I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit
tywin	You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty
loras	Well, my father once told me-
cersei	Nobody cares what your father once told you
joffrey	Congratulations, my lady
sansa	Thank you, Your Grace
joffrey	Well, youve done it Youve married a Lannister Soon youll have a Lannister baby Its a dream come true for you, isnt it? What a glorious day
sansa	Yes, Your Grace
joffrey	I suppose it doesnt really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you Maybe Ill pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out Howd you like that?
joffrey	You wouldnt? Thats all right Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down
joffrey	Time for the bedding ceremony
tyrion	There will be no bedding ceremony
joffrey	Wheres your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed Get rid of her gown She wont be needing it any longer Ladies, attend to my uncle Hes not heavy
tyrion	There will be no bedding ceremony
joffrey	There will be if I command it
tyrion	Then youll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock
joffrey	What did you say? What did you say?
tywin	I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace Im sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king
tyrion	A bad joke, Your Grace Made out of envy of your own royal manhood Mine is so small My poor wife wont even know Im there
tywin	Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace
tyrion	I am Guilty But but it is my wedding night
tyrion	My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do Come, wife
tyrion	I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act Not proud of it But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, dont you agree? Come, Ill tell you all about it Put you in the mood
sansa	Is that wise, my lord?
tyrion	Tyrion, Sansa My name is Tyrion
sansa	Is that wise, Tyrion?
tyrion	Nothing was ever wiser
tyrion	Astoundingly long
sansa	What?
tyrion	Neck You have one How old are you exactly?
tyrion	Well, talk wont make you any older My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage
tyrion	Stop I cant I could, I wont
sansa	But your father-
tyrion	If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start I wont share your bed Not until you want me to
sansa	What if I never want you to?
tyrion	And so my watch begins
missandei	Yes, Your Grace
daenerys	How can anyone speak 19 languages?
missandei	It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well
daenerys	Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope what do you mean reasonably well?
missandei	Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master So guttural and harsh
daenerys	Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it It gave him great pride
missandei	Athjahakar
daenerys	Athjahaka
missandei	Ath-ja-hakar
daenerys	Athjahakar
daenerys	Well, I suppose Im a bit out of practice
missandei	Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue It is the only proper language for poetry
daario	No screaming or she dies
daenerys	What do you want?
daario	You
daenerys	Let her go
daario	Dont scream, lovely girl
daenerys	You were sent here to kill me?
daenerys	So why havent you?
daario	I dont want to
daenerys	What do your captains have to say about that?
daario	You should ask them
daenerys	Why?
daario	We had philosophical differences
daenerys	Over what?
daario	Your beauty It meant more to me than it did to them
daenerys	Youre a strange man
daario	Im the simplest man youll ever meet I only do what I want to do
daenerys	And this is supposed to impress me?
daario	Yes
daenerys	Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
daario	They ordered me to murder you I told them I preferred not to They told me I had no choice I told them I am Daario Naharis I always have a choice They drew their swords and I drew mine
daenerys	Will you fight for me?
daenerys	Swear to me
daario	The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours
tyrion	You really ought to knock

gilly	It doesnt matter Come under the furs We can keep each other warm
sam	He winked at me before
gilly	I doubt it
sam	I saw him wink at me
gilly	He blinked
sam	I suppose its a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink
gilly	A what?
sam	Well, I mean, theres no real difference
gilly	A wink is on purpose
sam	You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name
gilly	Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
sam	What? No This is just the way I talk
gilly	Ill build that fire
sam	Dont you think he should have a name?
gilly	I dont know many boys names
sam	Lets see, theres Duncan, Kevan, Jon Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer
gilly	Craster
sam	Uh, yes Maybe thats not-
gilly	Mormont
sam	Thats a lovely idea, but Mormonts a last name
gilly	Why is it a last name?
sam	Well, its a family name For instance, Im Samwell Tarly Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name You see? So my father is also a Tarly
gilly	His name is Samwell Tarly, too?
sam	No, Randyll Tarly
gilly	Randyll is a handsome name
sam	Please dont name him Randyll
gilly	Is your father cruel like mine?
sam	Different manner of cruel
gilly	Not Randyll, then

catelyn	Are you sure about this?
robb	No
catelyn	Its dangerous
robb	If we take Tywins castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize hes not invincible Take his home, take his gold, take his power
catelyn	Why are you telling me?
robb	You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice
robb	Now Winterfell is burned to the ground The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone
robb	So, Casterly Rock? Im asking your advice
catelyn	We have enough men?
catelyn	If reinforcements arrive from Kings Landing, before we take the castle, well be caught between Tywins army and the sea
robb	Well lose the war and die the way father died Or worse
catelyn	Show them how it feels to lose what they love.The next scene shows ROBBS direwolf, Grey Wind, as he leads House Starks army to The Twins castle, the ancestral seat of House Frey
walder	My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven
robb	We thank you for your hospitality, my lord
robb	I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness
walder	Dont beg my forgiveness, your Grace It wasnt me you spurned, it was my girls
walder	One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are
walder	This is Arwyn, my daughter My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra
walder	My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila
walder	Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins You could have had either Could have had both for all I care
walder	My granddaughter Marianne My granddaughter Freya My granddaughter W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?
merry	Im Merry
walder	Fine And heres my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasnt bled yet Clearly you dont have the patience for all that
robb	My ladies All men should keep their word, kings most of all I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow The fault is not with you Any man would be lucky to have any one of you I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends
walder	Very good
walder	There she is Come closer, let me have a look at you
walder	Still cant see you Old eyes
walder	Love Thats what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Heh Very honorable, I call it a pretty face Mmmm, very pretty Prettier than this lot, thats for sure Very shapely as well Oh, you try to hide her under that dress If you wanted to hide her, you shouldnt have brought her here in the first place
walder	I can always see whats going on beneath a dress Been at this a long time I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is Doesnt drop an inch
walder	Your king says he betrayed me for love I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit
walder	And I can respect that When I was your age, Id have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought Well, Ive enough room in the hall for you lot Well set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men
robb	Thank you, my lord
walder	Well, lets get ready The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and well put this mess behind us -
daenerys	Where?
daario	There
daario	There, its a back gate My men use it when they visit Yunkais bed slaves
jorah	Your men but not you?
daario	I have no interest in slaves A man cannot make love to property
daario	This is where we enter the city Very few guards, they know me They let me inside
barristan	Were not gonna sneak an army through a back gate
daario	I kill the guards I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates
daario	Then comes the army Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours
jorah	Or perhaps youll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you wont have to split it three ways cause youve already slaughtered your partners
daario	You have a very suspicious mind In my experience, only dishonest people think this way
jorah	You command the Unsullied What do you think?
daenerys	Lo jention mirre numazme eza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa
grey worm	I trust him
daenerys	You leave tonight
jorah	Very good Well prepare
barristan	Ser Jorah You can use an extra sword
jorah	Youre the Queensguard, Ser Barristan Your place is by the Queen If we are truly her loyal servants, well do whatever needs to be done No matter the cost, no matter our pride -
sam	Were west of Castle Black, but the Nightforts closest to us It was the first castle on the Wall The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I Too big, impossible to maintain Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightforts the perfect castle for us Its got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself No ones used it for centuries, most likely It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do
gilly	How do you know all that?
sam	I read about it in a very old book
gilly	You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
sam	Yes
gilly	Youre like a wizard
gilly	Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived Here we are Alive -
sandor	Remember what happens to children who run Im your father and Ill do the talking
pig farmer	The roads have gone right to hell, havent they? Cracked three spokes this morning

pig farmer	Need about eight hands
pig farmer	Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding
pig farmer	Many thanks
arya	Dont! Dont kill him

sandor	Youre very kind Someday itll get you killed -
osha	Where are we?
bran	The Gift, I think Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night’s Watch for their sustenance and support Maester Luwin taught me that
jojen	Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment
meera	It’s good land and there’s no war up here Why leave?
bran	Wildlings
bran	Sorry But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women
rickon	Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it
rickon	That’s what Old Nan said
jojen	There’s a storm coming
bran	I don’t see any
meera	It’s as good a place to shelter as any
osha	We can drink some blood while we wait I don’t need much -
orell	Only one old man and eight good horses
tormund	What’s one old man doing with eight horses?
jon	He breeds them for the Watch
ygritte	How’s he keep folks from stealing them?
jon	The Watch protects him
orell	Not today they don’t He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there
tormund	And proper steel
orell	Let’s carve him up
jon	We just take the horses and go The old man’s no threat
orell	I keep telling you
ygritte	He’s an old man A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear
jon	The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers
tormund	I hope so Killing crows in their castle is tough Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do
tormund	Spread out Surround the hut and move in
jon	Ygritte
tormund	Clear the barn! -
arya	No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all
sandor	Best part of the animal
sandor	Don’t worry, they’re still there
arya	I know they’re still there
sandor	You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move
arya	I’m not afraid
sandor	Of course you are You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it The closer you get, the worse the fear gets No point in trying to hide behind that face I know fear when I see it Seen it a lot
arya	I knew fear when I saw it in you You’re afraid of fire
arya	When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl
arya	And I know why, too I heard what your brother did to you Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop
sandor	That give you some ideas?
arya	Might do
sandor	Go ahead then You might get away Might even make it there on your own They’re just over the river The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck
arya	Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull -
bran	How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it’s 700 feet high
bran	How did you get past it?
osha	Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals
bran	It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals
osha	Some climb straight up the ice
bran	Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back
hodor	Hodor
jojen	Nineteen castles guard the Wall Only three are still manned
hodor	Hodor
jojen	One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through
bran	My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted
meera	Well, we’ll have to open them up again

rickon	What’s That?
osha	That’s a horse dying
wildling	Bring them over here
wildling	That was the last of them The rest are dead
orell	I heard shouting up there
tormund	Thunder
orell	I know the difference between shouting and thunder
tormund	Maybe its ghosts
tormund	That won’t help you, grandpa
tormund	Where you riding?
old man	Doesn’t matter now, does it?
tormund	No, it doesn’t matter now
orell	Cut his throat or he’ll tell the crows we’re here
tormund	You understand
old man	Let me stand at least
old man	Let me go with a bit of dignity
orell	Make the crow kill him You’re one of us now Prove it
jojen	The wolves are out there
bran	I can’t do it by choice I don’t know how It happens in my dreams
jojen	You’re a warg, Bran It’s in your blood
bran	I can’t
jojen	You just did, with him
jojen	A wolf is nothing compared to that
old man	She looks sharp
ygritte	Do it Do it
orell	Told ya He’s still one of them
tormund	Go on, boy
tormund	Go on
orell	He’s a crow He’ll always be a crow And here’s his crow wife guarding him He’ll stab us in the back first chance he gets
tormund	Kill him
tormund	He’s one of them
ygritte	No
tormund	Do you hear me?
tormund	You’re not gonna die for one of them
jojen	Do it They’ll find us if you don’t
jon	You were right the whole time -
daario	When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come I’m a great whistler, the greatest in the land
daario	Daario Naharis
daario	That one was quick
jorah	There may be others
daario	I doubt it The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them
jorah	That’s what you call a few guards? -
roslin	Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you
edmure	You’re a delight to me, my lady
septon	You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
septon	In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity Look upon each other and say the words.EDMURE
roslin	Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days -
meera	Is that safe?
osha	They’re long gone
bran	You were right I can get inside Summer’s mind whenever I want
jojen	Of course you can North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals But you did a lot more than that You got inside Hodor’s mind
bran	They can’t do that north of the Wall?
jojen	No one can do that Anywhere
bran	When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon
rickon	Where?
bran	He was with the wildlings They tried to kill him but he got away
osha	He’ll be heading back to Castle Black then That’s where we should go
bran	For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack If this many wildlings got through
osha	I already told you I’m not going north of the Wall
bran	Everything Jojen told me is true You saw what I did to Hodor I have to find the three-eyed raven
osha	Listen to me, little lord
bran	Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to come with me It won’t be safe for Rickon
rickon	Me? I’m coming with you
bran	No You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth The Umbers are our bannermen They’ll protect you
rickon	I’m coming with you I’m your brother I have to protect you
bran	Right now, I have to protect you
bran	Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall If something happens to us, you’re the heir to Winterfell
bran	Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
osha	You Southerners build your big castles and you never move You’re easy to find
rickon	We’re not Southerners
rickon	And I don’t want to leave you
osha	Shhh Come here, little soldier You and me, we’re gonna have some adventures
bran	You don’t have to do any of this
osha	Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be Shhh We’ll be fine, you and me The Umbers are great warriors Even I heard about them growing up They’ll teach you how to swing a sword
rickon	I know how to swing a sword
bran	You’re leaving now? It’s the middle of the night
osha	I learned to walk in darkness
osha	Say your good-byes, little man
osha	Keep this one safe He means the world to me -
daenerys	We’ve been waiting a long time Haven’t we? Well I don’t know, you tell me How long does it take to sack a city?
jorah	It was just as you said They did not believe until it was too late Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered
daenerys	And Daario Naharis?
daario	The city is yours, my queen -
talisa	They’re good, aren’t they?
lothar	They ought to be because they cost enough
blackfish	Look at the crowd there
catelyn	He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him
blackfish	The God’s love to reward a fool
catelyn	Uncle
blackfish	What? He’s my nephew, I love him And he’s a damned fool
catelyn	Don’t you drink, Lord Bolton?
roose	Never do, my lady Dulls the senses
blackfish	That’s the point Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls?
roose	Aye Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry So I have a fat, young bride
catelyn	I hope she makes you very happy
roose	Well, she’s made me very rich
blackfish	Pardon, my lord, my lady I need to find a tree to piss on
robb	My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton I should rescue her
talisa	Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met
robb	Be kind She’s finally starting to like you
talisa	And I like her But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there , eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey’s hand
robb	Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake
robb	Striking your king is an act of treason
talisa	No, don’t Don’t insult them
walder	Your Grace
walder	The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak But they are not yet man and wife A sword needs a sheath And a wedding needs a bedding What does my sire say?
everybody	To bed! To bed! To bed
robb	If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them
everybody	To bed! To bed! To bed
edmure	Ho-ho! Careful now, ladies Once you set that monster free, there’s no caging him again
everybody	To bed! To bed! To bed
catelyn	Poor girl
roose	Every bride suffers the same I’m sure you endured yours with grace
catelyn	Oh, Ned forbade it He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night
talisa	That is a very strange custom
robb	I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective
talisa	It seems normal to you?
robb	It’s tradition Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage
talisa	No, but there are other ways of providing proof
robb	Boy or girl?
talisa	I don’t know But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him
robb	Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming
talisa	Eddard Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
robb	I do
sandor	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
frey guard	Where are you going?
sandor	Got salt pork for the feast
frey guard	The feast is over

frey guard	If I tell you it’s over, it’s over Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here
sandor	Got pig’s feet, too
frey guard	Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around
walder	Your Grace
walder	I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties
walder	I’ve given you meat and wine and music but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift
catelyn	Robb
man	You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?
man	Feast over yet, is it?
frey man	Aye, it’s over
sandor	It’s too late
walder	ing in the North arises, heh heh
catelyn	Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance
walder	You already swore me one oath right here in my castle You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter
catelyn	Take me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please
walder	And why I would let him do that?
catelyn	On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife’s throat
walder	I’ll find another
robb	Mother
man	Its too late
man	Yah! Yah

tyrion	Hmm Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall
sansa	What are you doing?
tyrion	I have a list
sansa	A list of people you mean to kill?
tyrion	For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme Fear of death, on the other hand-
sansa	You should learn to ignore them
tyrion	My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than theyve been laughing at you Im the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp
sansa	Youre a Lannister I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark
tyrion	The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey Were perfect for each other
sansa	So how should we punish them?
tyrion	Who? Whom?
sansa	Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall
tyrion	Ah I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert
sansa	I hear that youre a pervert
tyrion	I am the Imp I have certain standards to maintain
sansa	We could sheep shift Lord Desmonds bed You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again His room will stink, but he wont know where its coming from
tyrion	Lady Sansa
sansa	My sister used to do that when she was angry with me And she was always angry with me
tyrion	Why sheep shift?
sansa	Thats the vulgar word for dung
tyrion	My lady-
sansa	Well, you asked me
girl	Oh! Thats him
podrick	My lord, my lady Your father has called a meeting of the small council TYWIN, CERSEI, VARYS and PYCELLE are already seated JOFFREY walks behind his grandfather, excited and grinning
tyrion	Killed a few puppies today?
joffrey	Show him Come on, show him
pycelle	Oh, apologies, my lord Old fingers
tyrion	Roslin caught a fine fat trout Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding Signed Walder Frey Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
joffrey	Robb Stark is dead And his bitch mother Write back to Lord Frey Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Starks head Im going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast
varys	Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage
cersei	A joke Joffrey did not mean it
joffrey	Yes, I did Im going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast
tyrion	No She is no longer yours to torment
joffrey	Everyone is mine to torment Youd do well to remember that, you little monster
tyrion	Oh, Im a monster Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies
joffrey	I could have your tongue out for saying that
cersei	Let him make his threats Hmm? Hes a bitter little man
pycelle	Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste
joffrey	I am the king! I will punish you
tywin	Any man who must say, I am the king is no true king Ill make sure you understand that when Ive won your war for you
joffrey	My father won the real war He killed Prince Rhaegar He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock
tywin	The king is tired See him to his chambers
cersei	Come along
joffrey	Im not tired
cersei	We have so much to celebrate A wedding to plan You must rest
tywin	Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep
joffrey	Im not tired
cersei	Come
tywin	Not you
tyrion	You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper
tywin	Youre a fool if you believe hes the most powerful man in Westeros
tyrion	A treasonous statement Joffrey is king
tywin	You really think a crown gives you power?
tyrion	No I think armies give you power
tywin	Mm-hmm
tyrion	Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same
tywin	Mm-hmm
tyrion	Oh, I know Walder Frey gets all the credit Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No He never would have risked such an action if he didnt have certain assurances
tywin	Which he got from me Do you disapprove?
tyrion	Im all for cheating This is war
tywin	But to slaughter them at a wedding Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner
tyrion	So thats why you did it? To save lives?
tywin	To end the war To protect the family Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one Im in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood
tyrion	The northerners will never forget
tywin	Good Let them remember what happens when they march on the south All the Stark men are dead Winterfell is a ruin Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age
tywin	I believe you still have some work to do on that score
tyrion	Do you think shell open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
tywin	One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant
tyrion	I will not rape her
tywin	Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
tyrion	Use small words Im not as bright as you
tywin	The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first A good man does everything in his power to better his familys position regardless of his own selfish desires
tywin	Does that amuse you?
tyrion	No, its a very good lesson Only its easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when youre making all the decisions
tywin	Easy for me, is it?
tyrion	When have you ever done something that wasnt in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
tywin	The day that you were born I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away Instead, I let you live And I brought you as my son Because youre a Lannister
tyrion	Sansa
meera	Its empty
jojen	Lets find a place to sleep
hodor	Hodor Hodor
bran	Dont, Hodor
bran	Maybe we shouldnt stay
meera	Youd rather be out there?
bran	There are a lot of stories about this place Horrible stories
jojen	I always quite liked the horrible stories
bran	So did I Once
bran	You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
meera	No Whos he?
bran	Just a cook in the Nights Watch He was angry at the king for something, I dont remember When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the kings son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon That night he served the pie to the king He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young Hes been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies But no matter what he does, hes always hungry
meera	If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
bran	It wasnt for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the kings son in a pie He killed a guest beneath his roof Thats something the gods cant forgive
walder	The late Walder Frey, old Hoster called me because I didnt get my men to the Trident in time for battle He thought he was witty Look at us now, Tully Youre dead, your daughter-Catelyns dead, your grandsons dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and Im Lord of Riverrun
roose bolton	The Blackfish escaped
walder	An old man on the run with no allies I have Tywin Lannister backing me Who does he have?
roose bolton	As you say
walder	They all laughed at me, all those high lords They all thought they were better than me Ned Stark, Hoster Tully People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?
roose bolton	Youll be needing a new young girl
walder	Yeah Got that to look forward to
walder	And you, the Warden of the North No more Starks to bow and scrape to Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country
roose bolton	He ignored my advice at every turn If hed been a trifle less arrogant-
walder	Calling himself the Young Wolf Hows that for pomposity?
walder	Well, heres to the Young Wolf
roose bolton	Forever young
walder	Will you move to Winterfell now that the wars over?
roose bolton	At some point perhaps But Winterfells in ruins
walder	Yeah What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place I heard he killed all the ravens And after that, nothing
roose bolton	I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon
walder	Oh And?
roose bolton	Ramsay delivered the terms The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would They handed him over trussed and hooded But Ramsay well Ramsay has his own way of doing things
ramsay	Well, the girls werent lying You had a good-sized cock
ramsay	What? No Pork sausage You think Im some sort of savage?
ramsay	People talk about phantom limbs An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be So Ive always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
ramsay	Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?
ramsay	Sorry I shouldnt make jokes My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples
ramsay	But my father taught me to aim for their head
theon	Kill me
ramsay	Sorry, what?
theon	Kill me

davos	It was just a bit of blood
gendry	I should have known Every time a highborn asks my name, its trouble Were not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want
davos	Im not a highborn
gendry	She called you Ser I heard it
davos	A recent state of affairs I was born in Flea Bottom just like you
gendry	Sure, you were Youre my friend Youre here to help
davos	I lived below the Street of Flour

gendry	Gin Alley
davos	The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft You lived in the fancy part of town And here we are now Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king

varys	Youve been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his fathers money Now its just the drinking
shae	And now Im his wifes servant I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot

shae	I love that girl I would kill for her Do you think that makes it easier for me?
varys	No, I expect not
shae	Shes young and shes beautiful and highborn
varys	We break bread with them, but that doesnt make us family Weve learned their language, but well never be their countrymen If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-
shae	I have a name
varys	You have one name As do I Here only the family name matters
shae	What do you want from me, Lord Varys?
varys	Diamonds Id tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself Get on one of those ships Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house Hire servants Start a new life, a good life, far from here The mysterious foreign beauty Youll have suitors lining up
shae	Why do you want me to leave?
varys	Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name And you you are a complication I know you love him And I know its true love not bought by gold and silver Im not asking you to leave him for money Im asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him This will never be your home, my lady Find a true home somewhere far from here while theres still time
shae	Lord Varys
shae	If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself
tyrion	Keep up

tyrion	Its not easy being drunk all the time Everyone would do it if it were easy
cersei	Leave
cersei	So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchants best friend
tyrion	She doesnt deserve this
cersei	Deserve? Be careful with that Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long youll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world
tyrion	Theres nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher
tyrion	Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
cersei	I wont be marrying Ser Loras
tyrion	I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage
cersei	Youre not me You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child
tyrion	So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
cersei	So she can have some happiness in her life
tyrion	You have children How happy would you say you are?
cersei	Not very But if it werent for my children, Id have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep Theyre the reason Im alive
tyrion	Even Joffrey?
cersei	Even Joffrey He was all I had once Before Myrcella was born I used to spend hours looking at him His wisps of hair His tiny little hands and feet He was such a jolly little fellow You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies We should have known Even then we should have known Its nonsense Whenever he was with me, he was happy And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey how it feels to have someone Someone of your own
tyrion	How long does it go on?
cersei	Until weve dealt with all our enemies
tyrion	Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more
cersei	Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time

frey soldier	I did
frey soldier	I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one
frey soldier	It was me And Malcolm and Talbott Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time Took the skin right with it What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone Give it a nice firm mooring and-

melisandre	I take no credit I have faith and my faith has been rewarded
davos	Your Grace, the world has got so far bent Ive seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open I dont know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Womans sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong It is evil And you are not an evil man
stannis	Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?
davos	Aegon Targaryen
stannis	And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
davos	On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread
stannis	He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons Dragons are magic, Ser Davos My enemies have made my kingdom bleed I will not forget that I will not forgive that I will punish them with any arms at my disposal
davos	You do not need to burn the boy If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-
melisandre	And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne A great gift requires a great sacrifice
davos	His name is Gendry Hes a good lad A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew

stannis	Why am I gonna need you?
melisandre	My king
davos	Its from Maester Aemon of the Nights Watch Their Lord Commander is dead Took a ranging party north and never made it back One lad did, though What he saw beyond the Wall its coming for all of us
stannis	When did you learn to read?
davos	Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you
melisandre	This War of Five Kings means nothing The true war lies to the north, my king Death marches on the Wall Only you can stop him
davos	You cant stop him alone You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side
stannis	Ive made my decision
melisandre	Hes right You need him He has a part to play in the war to come
stannis	You see, Ser Davos? Youve been saved by that fire god you like to mock Youre in his army now
barristan	They will come, Your Grace When theyre ready
daenerys	Perhaps they didnt want to be conquered
jorah	You didnt conquer them You liberated them
daenerys	People learn to love their chains
missandei	This is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons It is to her you owe your freedom

jaime	Magnificent
tywin	Mm-hmm
jaime	Looks fresh-forged
tywin	It is
jaime	No ones made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria
tywin	There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel The finest of them was in Volantis Came here to Kings Landing at my invitation
jaime	Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
tywin	From someone who no longer had need of it
jaime	Youve wanted one of these in the family for a long time
tywin	And now we have two
jaime	Two?
tywin	The original weapon was absurdly large Plenty of steel for two swords
jaime	Well, thank you Its glorious
tywin	Youll have to train your left hand
jaime	Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands
tywin	Youll never be as good
jaime	No But as long as Im better than everyone else, I suppose it doesnt matter
tywin	You cant serve in the Kingsguard with one hand
jaime	Wheres that written? I can and I will ingsguard oath is for life
tywin	The war is over The king is safe The king is never safe
jaime	How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
tywin	Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner They will continue to do so when you go home
jaime	Home?
tywin	Youll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead
jaime	You are the Lord of Casterly Rock
tywin	I am the Kings Hand My place is here I dont expect to see the Rock again before I die
jaime	You know what they call me? Kingslayer Oathbreaker Man without honor Now you want me to break another sacred vow
tywin	You wont be breaking anything There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties The king will exercise that prerogative
jaime	No
tywin	No?
jaime	No
tywin	I dont believe I asked you a question
jaime	Theres my answer
tywin	If you think your bloody honor comes before.
jaime	My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no I dont want Casterly Rock I dont want a wife I dont want children
tywin	What do you want?
jaime	Supper would be nice
tywin	For 40 years Ive tried to teach you If you havent learned by now, you never will Go If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve
jaime	I suppose you want the sword back
tywin	Keep it
tywin	A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get
bronn	How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
tyrion	Please dont
bronn	Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside
tyrion	This is the Prince of Dorne were waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends
bronn	If hes so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?
tyrion	Theres bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock Has been for years
bronn	And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?
tyrion	No need for cynicism I happen to be an accomplished diplomat
bronn	Oh
tyrion	Ah, here we are
tyrion	Can you read the sigils?
bronn	Yellow balls?
podrick	Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood A vulture grasping a baby in its talons, House Blackmont A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave
tyrion	Boy knows his Dornish Houses
bronn	I need a sigil
tyrion	And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?
podrick	I dont see it, my lord
tyrion	Well met, my lords His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name My lord father, the Kings Hand, sends his greetings as well I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin Forgive me I dont see Prince Doran in your company
dornish lord	The princes health forces him to remain at Sunspear He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead
tyrion	Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast
dornish lord	Will he?
tyrion	And where is Prince Oberyn?
dornish lord	Arrived before dawn Not a man for welcome parties, our prince
tyrion	Very well My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep
tyrion	You must be weary after such a long journey
bronn	Some accomplished diplomacy that was Now where?
tyrion	We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies
bronn	How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
tyrion	Youre famous for fucking half of Westeros You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?
bronn	Id probably go to sleep, but Im getting old
oberyn	Look at this one How lovely is she?
ellaria	Beautiful But pale
oberyn	They like them pale in the capital Shows they dont work the fields Do I frighten you?
oberyn	You like?
ellaria	Timid Timid bores me
oberyn	Youre a bit of mischief, arent you?
oberyn	I think she likes you ELLARIA She has good taste
oberyn	Youre not timid, are you?
ellaria	Not timid
oberyn	Do you like women?
whore	When they look like her, my lord
ellaria	This one will do nicely
olyvar	Very good, my lady
ellaria	Oh, Im not a lady
olyvar	A term of courtesy in this establishment
ellaria	A lie anywhere Why not use the right words? Im a bastard She is a whore And youre what? A procurer
olyvar	Any of the others?
oberyn	The two girls can leave
oberyn	You stay
olyvar	Im afraid Im not an offer, my lord
oberyn	Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer Take off your clothes Well be here a while
olyvar	My lord
oberyn	I am a prince, boy Have you ever been with a prince?
olyvar	Cant say I have Im wildly expensive
oberyn	Take off your clothes
olyvar	Which way do you like it?
oberyn	My way
morgan	And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere And now the rains
ellaria	Oberyn
morgan	Weep oer his hall.
ellaria	Oberyn, dont
morgan	With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains weep oer his hall And not a soul to hear
morgans friend	You lost, friend?
oberyn	Forgive me for staring I dont see many Lannisters where Im from
morgans friend	I dont see many Dornishmen in the capital
oberyn	We dont like the smell
ellaria	Come with me, lover
morgan	Gods, look at this one
olyvar	Sirs, if you follow me, Ill arrange for a private room
morgan	Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil
oberyn	Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
oberyn	You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone May I tell you a secret? Youre not a golden lion Youre just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw
oberyn	Longsword is a bad option in close quarters When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding Quite a lot, Im afraid So many veins in the wrist
oberyn	Hell live if you get him help straightaway So, decisions
tyrion	Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion We heard there might be.
tyrion	trouble
oberyn	Apologies, my love
tyrion	Im here to welcome you to the capital
oberyn	Ellaria Sand, my paramour The kings own Uncle Imp Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister
tyrion	If theres anything I can do to make your stay.
oberyn	What are you? His hired killer?
bronn	It started that way, aye Now Im a knight
oberyn	How did that come to pass?
bronn	Killed the right people, I suppose
oberyn	Well need a few more girls Girls, yes? OBERYN You dont partake?
tyrion	Oh, I partook Now Im married
tyrion	Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?
oberyn	Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake
tyrion	Oh, they take all kinds
oberyn	Even Dornishmen
tyrion	The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding
oberyn	Let us speak truth here Joffrey is insulted I am only the second son after all
tyrion	Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult
tyrion	Why did you come to Kings Landing, Prince Oberyn?
oberyn	I was invited to the royal wedding
tyrion	I thought we were speaking truth
oberyn	The last time I was in the capital was many years ago Another wedding My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon My sister loved him She bore his children Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast Elia wouldnt let the wet nurse touch them And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman That started a war and the war ended right here when your fathers army took the city.
tyrion	I wasnt actually present
oberyn	And butchered those children My nephew and niece Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks And my sister, you know what they did to her?
oberyn	Im asking you a question
tyrion	Ive heard rumors
oberyn	So have I The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword
tyrion	I wasnt there I dont know what happened
oberyn	If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order Tell your father Im here And tell him the Lannisters arent the only ones who pay their debts
jorah	Theyre dragons, Khaleesi They can never be tamed Not even by their mother

daenerys	Whats the prize to winning this stupid contest?
daario	The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen

sansa	Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolfs head onto his body? And my mother They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river
tyrion	What happened to your family was a terrible crime I didnt know your brother He seemed like a good man, but I didnt know him Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her She was a strong woman And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children Sansa Your mother would want you to carry on You know its true
sansa	Will you pardon me, my lord? Id like to visit the godswood
tyrion	Of course Of course Prayer can be helpful, I hear
sansa	I dont pray anymore Its the only place I can go where people dont talk to me

tormund	Ill answer to Mance I wont answer to you

ygritte	Im not anybodys
styr	Too scrawny Not like those crows at Castle Black
styr	Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled
styr	I know weve had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow
officer	Draw Loose
jon	Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell He said, Next time I see you, youll be all in black I was jealous of Robb my whole life The way my father looked at him, I wanted that He was better than me at everything fighting and hunting and riding and girls Gods, the girls loved him I wanted to hate him, but I never could

alliser thorne	So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
jon	I didnt murder him
alliser thorne	No? You put your sword through a brother of the Nights Watch What do you call that?
jon	He wanted me to kill him
janos slynt	A bastard son of a traitor What would you expect?
jon	The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army
alliser thorne	Dont talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him He was my brother
jon	Then youd know hed do anything to defend the Wall The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him.
janos slynt	The free folk? Listen to him He even talks like a wildling now
jon	Aye, I talk like a wildling I ate with the wildlings I climbed the Wall with the wildlings I I laid with a wildling girl
janos slynt	You admit to breaking your vows, then?
jon	I do
janos slynt	The law is the law The boy must die
maester aemon	If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men
alliser thorne	Theres a difference between sneaking off to the Moles Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy
jon	While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000

jon	Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?
janos slunt	I commanded the City Watch of Kings Landing, boy
jon	And now youre here You must not have been very good at your job
janos slynt	How dare you?
jon	Theres a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane I killed their warg and three others They shot me full of arrows Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north The signal for the attack will be a bonfire Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen Thats the truth All the truth

brienne	Look me in the eye and tell me that you think shell be safe in Kings Landing

ramsay	I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer
locke	Word travels How he screamed You would have loved it
ramsay	Father
roose	What did you do to him?
ramsay	I trained him He was a slow learner, but he learned
roose	You flayed him
ramsay	Peeled a few bits Removed a few others
roose	This was Balon Greyjoys son and heir
ramsay	Weve been flaying our enemies for 1,000 years The flayed man is on our banners
roose	My banners, not yours Youre not a Bolton Youre a Snow Tywin Lannister has given me the North But he wont lift a finger to help me take it As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin
ramsay	I already asked Lord Greyjoy refused Savages have no.
roose	You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
ramsay	You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort I acted
roose	I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys I needed Theon I needed him whole
ramsay	Theon was our enemy But Reek, Reek will never betray us
roose	I placed far too much trust in you
ramsay	Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? Its disrespectful
theon	Im sorry, my lord
ramsay	Give him the razor
ramsay	If Im not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?
ramsay	Go on, Reek A nice close shave
ramsay	Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

roose	You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell
ramsay	Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?
theon	No, my lord Just two farm boys
ramsay	And crisped them so no one would know
theon	Yes, my lord
ramsay	The Starks have always ruled the North If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone
ramsay	Oh, thats right, Reek Robb Stark is dead Sorry I know he was like a brother to you But my father put a knife through his heart How do you feel about that?

theon	Jon Snow is at Castle Black
locke	Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
roose	Their bastard brother He could be sheltering them He may know where they are
ramsay	Even if he doesnt, hes half Stark himself Could be a threat

tyrion	So Im guilty of being seen with my own wifes handmaiden My father will ask you if theres anything more and youll tell him some clever lie
varys	No, I will not How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me No legendary brother to avenge me Only little birds who whisper in my ear
tyrion	Forgive me if I dont weep for you
varys	No one weeps for spiders or whores I have friends across the sea who could help her
tyrion	She wont leave Ive told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it

melisandre	Hear us now Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness
axell florent	Sire, I served you well
melisandre	Lord of Light, show us the way.
axell florent	Selyse, youre my sister
selyse	Yours are the stars that guide us
axell florent	Tell him! Tell him
melisandre	Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors
selyse	Did you see? Their souls It was their souls Our lord took them Did you see?
davos	"Lord Florent was your brother by law STANNIS He was an infidel"
davos	He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him They were the gods of your fathers, too
stannis	I ordered him to tear down his idols He disobeyed
davos	How many ships did he bring to your cause? How many men?
stannis	A good deal more than you
selyse	Did you see, Ser Davos? Theyre with our lord now Their sins all burned away Did you see?
davos	Im sure theyre more than grateful, my queen
stannis	Meats off
selyse	Our larders are almost empty
stannis	Serve fish, then Were on an island
selyse	You hate fish
stannis	I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same
selyse	When Storms End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books The binding glue is made from horses One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach Ive never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull Do you remember?
stannis	Of course I remember
selyse	Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?
melisandre	Its all I knew when I was a child
selyse	Until you found the Lord of Light?
melisandre	Until he found me
selyse	I fear for our daughters soul
melisandre	Every mother should fear for her childs soul
selyse	Shes a stubborn little beast
stannis	Shes a child
selyse	You barely know her You think shes sweet because she smiles when you visit Shes sullen and stubborn and sinful Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod
stannis	Shes my daughter You will not strike her
selyse	As you command Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her
shireen	Come in
melisandre	Were you sleeping, Princess?
melisandre	Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
shireen	I heard it
melisandre	And it frightened you?
shireen	Ser Axell was my uncle He was always kind to me
melisandre	Theyre in a better place now, Princess The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world
shireen	But they screamed
melisandre	Women scream when they give birth Afterward they are filled with joy
shireen	Afterward they arent ash and bone
melisandre	You have so many questions, dont you? So did I when I was a child I was much like you Only I wasnt a princess
shireen	And you didnt have this
melisandre	No But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me What do you know of the gods?
shireen	I read
melisandre	Lies and fables Septons speak of seven gods There are but two a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear Eternally at war
shireen	There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
melisandre	Theres only one hell, Princess The one we live in now
hodor	Hodor
bran	Why did you wake me?
meera	Youve been gone for hours
bran	I was hungry
meera	Were all hungry
bran	I was just eating
jojen	Summer was eating Your body cant live on the food your wolf consumes Spending too much time in Summers skin is dangerous Youre not a direwolf, Bran
jojen	Must be glorious, though To run, to leap, to hunt To be whole I know thats tempting, but if youre trapped in Summer for too long, youll forget what it was to be human
meera	Youd forget us, Bran Youd forget your mother and father Youd forget your brothers and sisters Youd forget Winterfell Youd forget you And if we lose you, we lose everything
bran	Hodor, take me to the tree THREE
eyed raven	Look for me beneath the tree
cersei	He saw us THREE
eyed raven	North
bran	I know where we have to go
high septon	Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder
joffrey	With this kiss, I pledge my love
sansa	We have a new queen
tyrion	Better her than you
tywin	Bit much, wouldnt you say?
olenna	It feels proportionate
tywin	Proportionate to what?
olenna	The expected extravagance
tywin	People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long
olenna	You ought to try enjoying something before you die You might find it suits you
olenna	Not now, Mace Lord Tywin and I are speaking
olenna	Anyway, I dont know what youre complaining about Im paying my share
tywin	Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
olenna	No, your heartfelt thank-you is its own reward I would imagine Id be hearing it again before long Wars are rather expensive The Iron Bank will have its due How they love to remind everyone Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts
tywin	Im not worried about the Iron Bank
olenna	We both know youre smarter than that Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love
bronn	All taken care of
tyrion	You saw her board the ship?
bronn	Aye, shes on it
tyrion	You saw the ship sail away?
bronn	No one knows shes there but you, me, and Varys
tyrion	How do you know?
bronn	Because if someone follows me without an invitation, Im the last person they ever follow
tyrion	Theres someone following you?
bronn	Shes gone I know you dont want to believe it, but she is Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing
oberyn	Hello
tyrion	Hello
oberyn	Not you
olenna	You look exquisite, child The wind has been at you, though I havent had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage
tyrion	My lady My lady
olenna	Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it You must excuse me Its time I ate some of this food I paid for
musician	A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine, my lord.
joffrey	"Very good Very good Off you go MARGAERY My love, why dont we make the announcement?"
joffrey	Everyone The queen would like to say a few words
margaery	We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink Not all among us are so lucky To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city
cersei	Youre an example to us all
loras	Ser Jaime, Im very sorry
jaime	Ser Loras, its quite all right Your sister looks very beautiful
loras	As does yours
jaime	So, looking forward to your wedding?
loras	Yes, very much
jaime	Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect
loras	They certainly are
jaime	Perhaps they should get married If you were to marry Cersei, shed murder you in your sleep If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, shed murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath Luckily for you, none of this will happen because youll never marry her
loras	And neither will you
brienne	Your Grace My king My queen
margaery	Lady Brienne So good of you to come
brienne	Im no lady, Your Grace
cersei	Did you just bow?
brienne	Apologies, Your Grace I never did master the curtsy
joffrey	Youre the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon
margaery	Thats not true, my love Brienne had nothing to do with it
joffrey	A shame Id knight the man that put an end to that deviants life
brienne	I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune The country has been at war too long I hope your reign is long and peaceful
joffrey	Yes, yes
margaery	Thank you I hope we see more of you
cersei	Lady Brienne Youre Lord Selwyn Tarths daughter That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not
brienne	As you say, Your Grace
cersei	I owe you my gratitude You returned my brother safely to Kings Landing
brienne	In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace More than once
cersei	Did he? Havent heard that story before
brienne	Not such a fascinating story, Im afraid
cersei	Im sure you have many fascinating stories Sworn to Renly Baratheon Sworn to Catelyn Stark And now my brother Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy
brienne	I dont serve your brother, Your Grace
cersei	But you love him
brienne	Your Grace
pycelle	No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally
cersei	Shell do no such thing
pycelle	Oh, Your Grace Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice.
cersei	You should see Qyburn Hes quite good
maid	Your Grace
pycelle	Qyburn? Deplorable man Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments
cersei	More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girls thighs?
pycelle	Your Grace, I am a man of learning
cersei	My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
pycelle	I never meant to annoy anyone
cersei	But you are You annoy me right now Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me So heres what I want you to do I want you to leave my presence Leave this wedding right now Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels
pycelle	Your Grace, Queen Margaery.
cersei	The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will
joffrey	A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fools hat off
tywin	Youre in rather a good mood
cersei	I suppose I am
tywin	I wont ask why
cersei	Small pleasures
oberyn	Your Grace Lord Tywin
tywin	Prince Oberyn
oberyn	I dont believe you have met Ellaria This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent I suppose it is former Queen Regent now Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand
ellaria	My lord My lady
tywin	Charmed
cersei	Cant say Ive ever met a Sand before
ellaria	We are everywhere in Dorne I have 10,000 brothers and sisters
oberyn	Bastards are born of passion, arent they? We dont despise them in Dorne
cersei	No? How tolerant of you
oberyn	I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked
cersei	I suppose youll never know, Prince Oberyn Its a shame your older brother couldnt attend the wedding
tywin	Please give him our regards With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again
oberyn	They call it the rich mans disease A wonder you dont have it
tywin	Noblemen in my part of the country dont enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne
oberyn	People everywhere have their differences In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place
joffrey	Everyone, silence! Clear the floor Theres been too much amusement here today A royal wedding is not an amusement A royal wedding is history The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history My lords my ladies.
joffrey	I give you King Joffrey Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy The War of the Five Kings
renly dwarf	Im the rightful king
robb dwarf	King in the North
joffrey dwarf	Yes
balon dwarf	Traitor Youre a traitor
joffrey dwarf	For the Seven Kingdoms
joffrey dwarf	Let the war begin
stannis dwarf	Renly, youre no king
balon dwarf	Away, degenerate Away Away
renly dwarf	Ooh, careful
stannis dwarf	Go on
renly dwarf	I want you to be my prince Stannis
balon dwarf	Whos got the gold now, Stark?
robb dwarf	I am the rightful king
balon dwarf	Challenge me, ruffian
robb dwarf	Take that
balon dwarf	Im drowning Im drowning
robb dwarf	I am the King in the North
stannis dwarf	Not wildfire
tyron	Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done
podrick	Yes, my lord
tyrion	Well have to find another way to thank the king
joffrey dwarf	Charge
joffrey dwarf	Ready, again
robb dwarf	I am the King in the North! Charge
joffrey dwarf	Charge! Yes
joffrey dwarf	Your head
joffrey dwarf	Fine gentlemen
joffrey	Well fought Well fought Here you are Champions purse Though youre not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign Uncle How about you? Im sure they have a spare costume
tyrion	One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace I would like to keep what remains of my face I think you should fight him This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle I speak as a firsthand witness Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne Be careful, though This one is clearly mad with lust It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night
tyrion	A fine vintage Shame that it spilled
joffrey	It did not spill
margaery	My love, come back to me Its time for my fathers toast
joffrey	Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as youre too cowardly to fight
tyrion	Your Grace does me a great honor
joffrey	Its not meant as an honor
joffrey	Bring me my goblet
joffrey	What good is an empty cup? Fill it
joffrey	Kneel Kneel before your king
joffrey	Kneel I said kneel
margaery	Look, the pie
joffrey	My queen
margaery	Wonderful Wonderful My hero
sansa	Can we leave now?
tyrion	Lets find out
joffrey	Uncle Where are you going? Youre my cupbearer, remember?
tyrion	I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace
joffrey	No, no, no No, youre perfect the way you are Serve me my wine
joffrey	Well, hurry up This pie is dry
joffrey	Mm, good Needs washing down
tyrion	If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired
joffrey	No No, youll wait here un.
tyrion	Your Grace?
joffrey	Its nothing
margaery	Hes choking
olenna	Help the poor boy
olenna	Idiots, help your king
jaime	Move away
jaime	Joffrey! Joffrey
cersei	Help him! Someone help him
cersei	Joffrey
ser dontos	Come with me now
cersei	Joffrey! Joffrey
ser dontos	If you want to live, we have to leave
cersei	Dont touch him
cersei	Joffrey Please, Joffrey Joffrey, what is it? Help him! He reaches a hand out towards TYRION, who at that moment picks up the goblet from before him JOFFREY gaps a final time as blood continues to stream from his nose, his face a horrid shade of purple He dies
cersei	My son
man	Hes gone Our king is gone
cersei	He did this He poisoned my son, your king Take him Take him Take him Take him
cersei	You did this You did this! As Sansa looks on, Ser Dontos Hollard approaches her
ser dontos	We have to leave
cersei	Take him! Take him
cersei	Where is his wife? Wheres Sansa?
tywin	Find her Bar the gates of the city Seize every ship in the harbor
cersei	Where is she?
tywin	No one leaves the capital! No one
ser dontos	Get in
sansa	Where are we going?
ser dontos	Somewhere safe
ser dontos	Up you go, my lady Youll be fine Youre stronger than you know
sansa	Lord Baelish?
littlefinger	Petyr Are you hurt, my lady?
littlefinger	Good Good Im sure youve had quite a fright Rest easy The worst is past Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat
ser dontos	Lord Baelish I promised Id get her to you safely
littlefinger	Softly, my friend Voices carry over water
ser dontos	I should get back before someone thinks to look for me LITTLEFINGER First youll want your pay 10,000 was it?
ser dontos	10
ser dontos	Wait
littlefinger	Shh You dont want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?
sansa	I didnt murder anyone
littlefinger	I know I know But you must admit it looks suspicious The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder
sansa	Why did you kill him?
littlefinger	Because he was a drunk and a fool and I dont trust drunk fools
sansa	He saved me
littlefinger	Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders Every one of them And he did it all for gold Money buys a mans silence for a time A bolt in the heart buys it forever
sansa	He was helping me because I saved his life
littlefinger	Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother The last legacy of House Hollard
littlefinger	I had it made a few weeks ago What did I once tell you about the capital?
sansa	Were all liars here
littlefinger	Come, my lady I know youve had a difficult day But youre safe now I promise you that Youre safe with me and sailing home
margaery	So am I the queen?
olenna	More than you were with Renly Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue
margaery	Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop it was horrible
olenna	The world is overflowing with horrible things But theyre all a tray of cakes next to death They brought me your grandfathers body when he died, you know? Made me look at it
margaery	What was it like?
olenna	They took me to the Great Hall and there he was The man Id married and suffered to father my children A great doughy lump Id sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings There he was lying on a table
margaery	One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast I must be cursed
olenna	Nonsense Your circumstances have improved markedly You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that
margaery	But I would have been the queen
olenna	Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us You did wonderful work on Joffrey The next one should be easier
tywin	Your brother is dead Do you know what that means?
tywin	Im not trying to trick you
tommen	It means Ill become king
tywin	Yes, you will become king What kind of king do you think youll be?
tommen	A good king?
tywin	Mm, I think so as well Youve got the right temperament for it But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good kings single most important quality?
cersei	This is hardly the place or the time
tommen	Holiness?
tywin	Hmm Baelor the Blessed was holy And pious He built this sept He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful
tommen	Justice
tywin	Yeah A good king must be just Orys I was just Everyone applauded his reforms Nobles and commoners alike But he wasnt just for long He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
tommen	No
tywin	No
tommen	What about strength?
tywin	Yes Strength King Robert was strong He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing What do they all lack?
tommen	Wisdom
tywin	Yes
tommen	Wisdom is what makes a good king
tywin	Yes But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you How do you know which choice is wise and which isnt? Youve any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
tommen	No
tywin	No Of course not A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesnt Youre young A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards Your brother was not a wise king Your brother was not a good king If he had been, perhaps hed still be alive Now, as the king, you will have to marry Do you understand why?
tommen	A king needs a queen
tywin	Yes, but why? To further the family line Do you know how that happens?
tommen	Yes
tywin	Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?
tommen	I dont think so Its all relatively straightforward
jaime	How are you?
tommen	Im all right
jaime	You are You will be Ill see to that
jaime	Please give the queen a moment alone with her son
high septon	Yes, my lord All of you
cersei	It was Tyrion He killed him He told me he would A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth Thats what he said to me You saw it You saw Joff point at him just before he.
jaime	I dont know what I saw
cersei	Avenge him Avenge our son Kill Tyrion
jaime	Tyrions my brother Our brother Therell be a trial Well get to the truth of what happened
cersei	I dont want a trial Hell squirm his way to freedom given the chance I want him dead Please, Jaime You have to He was our son Our baby boy
jaime	Youre a hateful woman Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
cersei	Jaime, not here, please Please
cersei	Stop it Stop it Stop
jaime	No
cersei	Stop it Stop
cersei	Stop Stop Its not right
cersei	Its not right Its not right
jaime	I dont care
cersei	Dont
jaime	I dont care
cersei	Dont Jaime, dont
jaime	I dont care
arya	Gonna rain soon Where are we?
sandor	Near Fairmarket, I think
arya	You think? You dont have a map?
sandor	No, I dont have a map
arya	Maybe we should get one
sandor	Just point out the next map shop you see and Ill buy you one
arya	How far is it to the Eyrie?
sandor	Far
arya	And youre sure were going the right way?
sandor	Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can Get my gold, be on my way
arya	On your way where?
sandor	Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea Fight as a sellsword Second Sons, could be Seems like a good fit for me
arya	Id like to see Braavos one day
sandor	Why Braavos?
arya	I have friends there
sandor	I doubt it
farmer hamlet	Seven blessings to you
sandor	What do you want?
farmer hamlet	What do I want? This is my land
sandor	If Im standing on it, its my land
arya	We were just watering the horses Well be on our way Forgive my father He was wounded fighting in the war Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it
arya	Hes never been the same
farmer hamlet	Which house did he fight for?
arya	The Tullys of Riverrun
farmer hamlet	Theres a storm coming Youll be wanting a roof tonight Theres fresh hay in the barn And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do We dont have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it
farmer hamlet	We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil We ask the Maiden to protect Sallys virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity
sandor	You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
arya	Father
farmer hamlet	We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness
sandor	And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all
arya	Im so sorry
arya	Really good
farmer hamlet	Did you fight at the Twins?
sandor	Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like
farmer hamlet	The Red Wedding theyre calling it Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day He shared bread and salt with the Starks He offered them guest right
sandor	Guest right dont mean much anymore
farmer hamlet	It means something to me The gods will have their vengeance Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands We had good years and bad years, same as anyone But we were safe Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the norths no better The whole countrys gone sour
sandor	You got any ale?
farmer hamlet	Afraid not
sandor	How can a man not keep ale in his home?
farmer hamlet	You look like you could really swing that sword A real warrior with proper training Those raiders wouldnt stand a chance against you How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork Sally does what she can, but she cant lift a bale of hay And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, Id bet theyd run the other way Meaning no offense
sandor	Whatll you pay? I dont have much But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits Fair wages for fair work?
sandor	Fair wages for fair work
arya	What did you do?
sandor	Get your horse saddled
arya	You told me you werent a thief
sandor	I wasnt
arya	He took us in He fed us and you.
sandor	Aye, he took us in Hes a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew And theyll both be dead come winter
arya	You dont know that
sandor	I do know it Hes weak He cant protect himself Theyll both be dead come winter Dead men dont need silver
arya	Youre the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms
sandor	Theres plenty worse than me I just understand the way things are How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
ranger	Raper Raper Horse thief Ninth born son Raper Thief Thief and raper

gilly	I dont know It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesnt it?
sam	So are you all right? No one bothering you?
gilly	I get a lot of looks I hear them making their jokes But no ones touched me if thats what you mean
sam	I worry about it sometimes All the time
gilly	Why do you worry about it?
sam	100 men, one woman
gilly	Theyve got other things to think about
sam	Thats the only thing they think about
gilly	Youre being silly
sam	Im not being silly Theres 100 men lying awake at night picturing you

sam	What about me? Gilly? I worry about you
gilly	Thank you

davos	Your Grace
stannis	Youre a literary man now What do you make of that?
davos	Joffrey?
stannis	The usurper Joffrey Baratheon I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire A leech filled with bastard blood A bastard you set free I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it
davos	I will find you an army, Your Grace Ive been working day and night.
stannis	What progress have you made?
davos	Ive rallied House Peasebury to your cause
stannis	House Peasebury
davos	House Musgood
stannis	House Musgood
davos	And House Haigh
stannis	House Haigh They dont have enough men between them to raid a pantry
davos	Westeros is not the world, Your Grace We need to look east for ships and men 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company
stannis	The Golden Company?
davos	Theyve never broken a contract
stannis	Theyre sellswords
davos	Were willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but were not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Womans magic is real Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but Ive never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war Soldiers win wars Soldiers on the ground Its dirty on the ground
stannis	We dont have any gold
davos	Not yet
stannis	If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten I will not become a page in someone elses history book Im running out of time, Ser Davos Which means youre running out of time
shireen	Youre late
davos	Im sorry, Princess
shireen	I thought you werent coming
davos	The Hand of the King doesnt have much leisure time
shireen	You wont be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say ka-nigit
davos	That happened once, weeks ago Youre your fathers daughter, no mistake Bloody relentless, the both of you
shireen	Its a new one today Lots of tricky words But I think you can manage
shireen	Youll never read well if you move your lips Thats how children do it
davos	The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas First Sword of Braavos
davos	Thank you very much
shireen	I like this one Its full of sword fights and pirates You were a pirate once
davos	No, I was never a pirate I was a smuggler
shireen	Whats the difference?
davos	Well, if youre a famous smuggler, youre not doing it right
shireen	My father says a criminal is a criminal
davos	Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior So do the Braavosi
shireen	Youve sailed to Braavos?
davos	Of course Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didnt seem any more interested in the distinction than your father I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction.
shireen	What was that for?
davos	I need you to write a message
shireen	You should write it yourself Its good practice
davos	Its too important for me I need a smart person to do it Go on
davos	To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros
shireen	But thats not you
davos	I need to get their attention Go on Write

sam	Oh, Gilly Please dont
oberyn	Greedy
ellaria	No?
olyvar	Im sorry Youre lovely, I just never acquired the taste
oberyn	Youre calling my beauty an acquired taste?
ellaria	Thats quite all right, lover Its more for you
oberyn	Your loss
olyvar	You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
oberyn	Does that surprise you?
olyvar	Everyone has a preference
oberyn	Then everyone is missing half the worlds pleasure The gods made that and it delights me The gods made this and it delights me When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne When it comes to love, I dont choose sides
olyvar	I hope I have as much stamina when Im your age
oberyn	What are you, 25?
ellaria	Children
oberyn	Someday, if youre lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old That pretty ass of yours will sag Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears No one will want you anymore Make sure you fucked your fill before that day
olyvar	Did you?
ellaria	He is a prince of Dorne Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies
oberyn	They will all have to line up behind you
tywin	Prince Oberyn
oberyn	Lord Tywin
tywin	May we have the room?
ellaria	Call my name if you need me, lover
oberyn	Would you like to sit?
tywin	No, thank you
oberyn	Some wine?
tywin	No, thank you
oberyn	Im sorry about your grandson
tywin	Are you?
oberyn	I dont believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father Or his grandfather An awful way to die
tywin	Which way is that?
oberyn	Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?
tywin	Some believe the king choked
oberyn	Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant The king was poisoned
tywin	I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel
oberyn	I did This is why I know
tywin	Your hatred for my family is rather well known You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning
oberyn	Rather suspicious Why havent you thrown me in a dungeon?
tywin	You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived What did you discuss?
oberyn	You think we conspired together?
tywin	What did you discuss?
oberyn	The death of my sister
tywin	For which you blame me
oberyn	She was raped and murdered by the Mountain The Mountain follows your orders Of course I blame you
tywin	Here I stand unarmed, unguarded Should I be concerned?
oberyn	You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that I am a man of reason If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow
tywin	Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors knowledge
oberyn	So you deny involvement in Elias murder?
tywin	Categorically
oberyn	I would like to speak with the Mountain
tywin	Im sure he would enjoy speaking with you
oberyn	He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would
tywin	I could arrange for this meeting
oberyn	But you want something in return
tywin	There will be a trial for my son And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict I will preside Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge I would like you to be the third
oberyn	Why?
tywin	Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon Declared themselves enemies of the throne Now they are our strongest allies
oberyn	Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen Asking me to judge at your sons trial isnt quite as tempting
tywin	I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new kings principal advisors
oberyn	I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin
tywin	We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold The king is dead The Greyjoys are in open rebellion A wildling army marches on the Wall And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons
oberyn	Youre saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit
tywin	We need each other You help me serve justice to the kings assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elias
tyrion	Podrick Apologies for the stench
podrick	I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me
tyrion	A noble effort
podrick	They didnt find the candles, though A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese
tyrion	Youre a good lad Any word of Shae?
podrick	Ive heard nothing, my lord
tyrion	I suppose thats a good thing What are they saying about me out there?
podrick	Youre to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king
tyrion	Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
podrick	No, my lord You didnt?
tyrion	No Gods, no The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, Id plan it in such a way that I wouldnt be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died Trial in a fortnight Have they announced the judges yet?
podrick	Your father
tyrion	Of course
podrick	Mace Tyrell
tyrion	Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote
podrick	And Prince Oberyn of Dorne
tyrion	Oberyn? Give it to my father He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy
podrick	Im supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord Anyone who might testify on your behalf
tyrion	Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them Very well, my wife Sansa
podrick	My lord, shes gone
tyrion	Gone?
podrick	No ones seen her since the wedding You dont think she.
tyrion	No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it And with my wifes disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty Podrick
podrick	Yes, my lord?
tyrion	Theyll be following you now
podrick	Who will?
tyrion	I dont know They They The ominous they The man pulling the strings Or woman My father Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume its my sister that had a hand in it But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children She is the only one Im certain had nothing to do with this murder Which makes it unique as Kings Landing murders go
podrick	Any other witnesses, my lord?
tyrion	Varys could vouch for me if he dared
podrick	Hes already been called as a witness for the queen
tyrion	Of course Fetch Bronn I have a job for him
podrick	Ive already asked, my lord They wont let him see you
tyrion	Why not?
podrick	They say hes a known cutthroat and your close associate Hes under investigation himself
tyrion	And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
podrick	Ill ask, my lord
podrick	Theres something else, my lord A man, I didnt know his face, he came to ask if Id testify against you Said Id be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges youd bought a poison called the Strangler
tyrion	Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it What did you tell him?
podrick	I didnt tell them anything, my lord
tyrion	Are you going to accept their offer?
podrick	My lord
tyrion	Testifying against me wasnt a suggestion If they cant tempt you with honey, theyll choose something less sweet
podrick	Youve been good to me, my lord
tyrion	Pod, the trials in a fortnight Theyll want an answer before that
podrick	I already gave them an answer, my lord

yarwyck	We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind
men	Aye! Aye
yarwyck	Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall Seems like that would be a good lesson
men	Aye
alliser thorne	If we go after them, well be giving them what they want They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time
maester aemon	We have just over 100 men And thats including stewards and builders And me We cant afford to lose a single man We must remember our first responsibility We are the watchers on the Wall
pyp	Theres got to be a way to protect them
alliser thorne	Youre a champion of the common people, Lord Snow What do you say to Brother Pyps proposition?
jon	Mance Rayder is coming If the wildlings breach the Wall, theyll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them
alliser thorne	We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall That is our job
pyp	Rangers returning
jon	Help him
dolorous edd	Thought youd have blue eyes by now
alliser thorn	What took you so long?
grenn	We were held up
alliser thorn	By what?
grenn	Chains
dolorous edd	We were guests of the mutineers at Crasters Keep
jon	And the mutineers stayed?
dolorous edd	Theyre not going anywhere Theyve got Crasters food and his wives Poor girls Never thought theyd miss their daddy Karls running things now Hes the one who put a knife through Crasters mouth
jon	We need to ride north and kill them all
alliser thorn	We just went over this, boy -Justice can wait
jon	Its not about justice I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do How long do you think theyll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesnt know it yet As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will Then hell throw his full strength at us And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, theres still not a thing we can do to stop them
pyp	I dont think I can kill 100 wildlings
daenerys	Are they attacking?
jorah	A single rider A champion of Meereen They want you to send your own champion against him
daenerys	What is he doing?
barristan selmy	I believe he means to.
missandei	He says that were an army of men without man parts He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who hides his cock in his own asshole
barristan selmy	Ignore him, Your Grace These are meaningless words
jorah	Theyre not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them
daenerys	I have something to say to the people of Meereen First, I will need this one to be quiet Do I have a champion?
grey worm	Allow me this honor, mother of dragons I will not disappoint you
daenerys	You are the commander of the Unsullied I cannot risk you

jorah	Ive been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi Let me stand for you today as well
daenerys	You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend I will not gamble with your life
daario	I was the last to join your army Im not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied My mother was a whore I come from nothing And before long, I will return to nothing Let me kill this man for you
daenerys	Very well You have quite an audience Make it worth their while
missandei	He is very brave, Your Grace
daenerys	Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching
daenerys	You sure you dont want a horse?
daario	Why would I want a horse?
daenerys	Horses are faster than men
daario	Horses are dumber than men
daenerys	I am Daenerys Stormborn
daenerys	Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing It does not matter I have nothing to say to them Only to you First I went to Astapor Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free Next I went to Yunkai Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free Now I have come to Meereen I am not your enemy Your enemy is beside you
daenerys	Your enemy steals and murders your children Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands I do not bring commands I bring you a choice And I bring your enemies what they deserve Forward
daenerys	Fire
grey worm	My name is Grey Worm I come from the Summer Ills
missandei	Isles Summer Isles

grey worm	Missandei is teacher good, my queen
daenerys	Youll have to continue later Its time
mossador	You heard her! She said she came to free us
elder meereen slave	You are a fool The masters are too strong
mossador	She will protect us She defeated the masters champion
mossador	She has a great army You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
meereen slave	I want to live You saw what they did to those children What do you think theyll do to us?
elder meereen slave	Ive been through two slave revolts, boy They always end the same way the Masters in power and the slaves dead
grey worm	All men must die
grey worm	But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains
elder meereen slave	Who are you?
grey worm	This one is called Grey Worm I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains
elder meereen slave	You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk We are not soldiers
meereen slave	We have no training, weapons
grey worm	There are three slaves in this city for every Master No one can give you your freedom, brothers If you want it, you must take it
slaves	Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa
slaves	Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa
slaves	Mhysa! Mhysa
daenerys	Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?
jorah	163, Khaleesi
daenerys	Yes, that was it
barristan selmy	Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours All these people,theyre your subjects now Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy
daenerys	I will answer injustice with justice
jaime	What the hell was that?
bronn	That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand
jaime	Youre a rare talent When youre fighting cripples, anyway
bronn	You learned to fight like a good little boy Ill bet that thrust through the MadKings back was pretty as a picture You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
jaime	You talk to my brother this way?
bronn	All the time He got used to it
jaime	Do you think he did it?
bronn	No Oh, he hated the little twat, sure But who didnt? And poisons not his style Or murder, for that matter You want to know for sure, why dont you ask him?
bronn	You havent been to see him yet, eh?
jaime	Were done for today
bronn	Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
jaime	You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie
bronn	Aye But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day You were his first choice He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him You gonna fight for him now?
jaime	To tell you the truth, this isnt so bad Four walls A pot to piss in I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months
tyrion	Is that supposed to make me feel better?
jaime	Maybe a bit Im sorry I didnt come sooner
tyrion	Its complicated, yes So how is our sister?
jaime	How do you think? Her son died in her arms
tyrion	Her son?
jaime	Dont You know whats coming?
tyrion	My trial for regicide.Yes, I know I know the whole bloody country thinks Im guilty I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count And that judge is my father As for Cersei, well, shes probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed
jaime	Now that you mention it, she did ask
tyrion	So, should I turn around and close my eyes?
jaime	Depends Did you do it?
tyrion	ingslayer brothers You like it? I like it Youre really asking if I killed your son?
jaime	Are you really asking if Id kill my brother? How can I help you?
tyrion	Well, you could set me free
jaime	You know I cant
tyrion	Then theres really nothing else to say
jaime	What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? Im the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
tyrion	Sorry, Id forgotten Id hate for you to do something inappropriate
jaime	Inappropriate? Youre accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason
tyrion	Except I didnt do it
jaime	Which is why were having a trial A trial If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldnt matter to Cersei She wont rest until my heads on a spike
jaime	Not just yours Shes offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark
tyrion	Sansa couldnt have done this She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms Do you think its a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
tyrion	No, but Sansas not a killer Not yet, anyway
sansa	Where are you taking me?
littlefinger	Im getting married to your Aunt Lysa Shes waiting for us at the Eyrie Youll be safe there
sansa	Did you kill Joffrey?
littlefinger	Did I kill Joffrey? Ive been in the Vale for weeks
sansa	I know it was you
littlefinger	And who helped me with this conspiracy?
sansa	Well, there was Ser Dontos You used him to get me out of Kings Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king
littlefinger	Why not?
sansa	Because youre too smart to trust a drunk
littlefinger	Then perhaps it was your husband
sansa	No
littlefinger	How do you know?
sansa	I just do
littlefinger	Youre right He wasnt involvedi n Joffreys death But you were Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I dont suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast
sansa	The poison I dont understand The Lannisters gave you wealth, power Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal
littlefinger	A man with no motive is a man no one suspects Always keep your foes confused If they dont know who you are or what you want, they cant know what you plan to do next
sansa	I dont believe you If they catch you, theyll put your head on a spike just like my fathers Youd risk that just to confuse them?
littlefinger	So many men they risk so little They spend their lives avoiding danger And then they die Id risk everything to get what I want
sansa	And what do you want?
littlefinger	Everything My friendship with the Lannisters was productive But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally And who could trust a friend like that?
sansa	Who could trust you?
littlefinger	I dont want friends like me My new friends are predictable Very reasonable people As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong
margaery	I cant believe youre going Leaving me alone here with these people
olenna	The time has come, my dear Theres nothing more tedious than a trial Except perhaps these gardens If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, Ill fling myself from the cliffs
olenna	Have you been to see Tommen yet?
margaery	No Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything
olenna	I wasnt originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola I was to be given to some Targaryen or other Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferrets face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldnt do So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber
olenna	How absentminded of me
margaery	Mm-hmm
olenna	The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister cause the boy couldnt bloody walk
olenna	And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what Id given him the night before I was good I was very, very good You are even better But you need to act quickly Cersei may be vicious, but shes not stupid Shell turn the boy against you as soon as she can And by the time youre married, itll be too late Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didnt commit
margaery	Well, he could have done
olenna	He could have done,but he didnt
margaery	You dont know, Grandmother
olenna	But I do know You dont think Id let you marry that beast, do you?
margaery	What? I dont understand
olenna	Shh Dont you worry yourself about all that You just do what needs to be done
jon	Bring it through! And again
jon	Very nice Good
jon	A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds
jon	Lets see what you can do
jon	Olly, you just watch for now
olly	I can fight
jon	Have you ever held a sword before I was the best archer in our hamlet
olly	I was
grenn	I believe you Well go hunting for rabbits one day Right now, watch and learn
jon	You two Take it slow, try and disarm each other
jon	You know how to fight You could have gone easier on him
locke	He wouldnt have learned anything that way
alliser thorne	Lord Snow What do you think youre doing?
jon	Grenn and I were helping them
alliser thorn	Grenns a ranger.Youre a steward Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didnt
jon	Someone has to train them
alliser thorne	And that someone isnt you Go find a chamber pot to empty Go on Do it You traitors bastard Give me an excuse Mormonts not hereto protect you now
alliser thorne	Get back to work Now! I said now
janos slynt	The bastards well-liked.Youre not
alliser thorne	You think I care if they like me? Were at war
janos slynt	For now But you cant be acting commander forever There will be a choosing The old maester will insist on it You might reconsider his request to marchon Crasters Let the mutineer stake care of Snow Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life
locke	A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn
jon	My father was highborn My mother wasnt
locke	Names Locke
jon	Jon Snow
jon	You fight well
locke	What brought you up here? A sense of duty I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm I was a game warden in the Stormlands Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids I was stupid enough to get caught Chose the Wall over losing my hand Figured I wouldnt have to suck up to any highborn cunts here
alliser thorne	Come on, get on with it What are you waiting for? Summer?
locke	Guess I was wrong
jaime	You sent for me, Your Grace?
cersei	Your Grace How formal of you How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommens door?
jaime	Ser Boros is on duty tonight Tomorrow I believe.
cersei	So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
jaime	I promise you Tommens safe Were protecting him
cersei	The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
jaime	What?
cersei	Ive been wondering for months Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital Why did she set you free?
jaime	You know why Shed hoped Id send her daughters back to her
cersei	She hoped or did you promise?
jaime	I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, Id return them to her
cersei	So you made a sacred vow to the enemy
jaime	I wanted to get back to you Should I have told hert o fuck off?
cersei	You didnt mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
jaime	Catelyn Starks dead So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?
cersei	I know you went to see Tyrion That creature who murdered our son
jaime	I had to see him I had to know for myself
cersei	And?
jaime	He didnt do it, Cersei
cersei	Youve always pitied him Our poor little brother Abused by the world Despised by his father and sister Hed kill us all if he could I want four men at Tommens door day and night That will be all, Lord Commander
tommen	Ser Pounce?
tommen	How did you get past the Kingsguard?
margaery	Kingsguard
tommen	I dont think youre supposed to be here Mother doesnt allow me to have visitors at night
margaery	Im not a visitor, Your Grace Word has itIm to be your bride
margaery	Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another Dont you think?
tommen	Yes But if my mother found out.
margaery	It can be our secret Hmm? If were going to be man and wife, well have a few secrets from her, I hope So, Your Grace.
tommen	Yes? Tell me a secret
margaery	Hello Arent you a proper fellow?
tommen	Thats Ser Pounce
margaery	Very handsome
tommen	Joffrey didnt like him He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldnt know I was eating him
margaery	Thats very cruel You dont strike me as cruel
tommen	No I dont think I am
margaery	Thats a relief Because you know what happens when we marry?
tommen	We say our vows in front of the High Septon And after the ceremony, theres a feast
margaery	When we marry, I become yours Forever Its getting late I should go May I come and visit you again? All right, then
margaery	Remember, our little secret

jaime	I hope I got your measurements right
brienne	Ill find her For Lady Catelyn And for you
jaime	I almost forgot I have one more gift
brienne	I dont need a squire

brienne	Oathkeeper
jaime	Good-bye, Brienne
podrick	Come on, move
sam	I should neverhave taken her away
jon	She wasnt safe here
sam	Shes not safe out there I should have known You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall If theyre raiding the smaller villages, Moles Town could be next
jon	Castle Black could be next
sam	I should go back for Gilly
jon	We have orders No ones to leave the castle
sam	I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb
jon	And I remember who came after me and brought me home I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him
sam	I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me I tried Really, I did
jon	How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
sam	I dont know Theyd pass wildling villages They could try to find shelter at one of them
jon	The wildlings have joined up with Mance Every village or sheltered place will be deserted Except.
sam	Crasters? You think Bra nmight have found.
locke	Snow I dont mean to interrupt Thorne wants to see you

jon	Ahem, brothers
jon	Im going beyond the Wallto Crasters Keep Im going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them Im asking for volunteers to come with me Theres 60 miles of wilderness between here and Crasters and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does They know the Wall They know our defenses If Mance learns what they know, were lost But if thats not enough, then consider this If the Nights Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men Stabbed in the back by cowards He deserved far better All we can give him now is justice Who will join me?
jon	I cant let a recruit come north of the Wall
locke	Then let me say my vows If its a fight youre heading for, then you need men who know how
jon	Thank you, brothers

barristan	The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea
jorah	The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have
jorah	Theres other news From Yunkai Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city Theyve reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon whos declared himself His Imperial Majesty
daenerys	Please leave me Not you, Jorah
daenerys	It appears my liberation of Slavers Bay isnt going quite as planned
jorah	You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind A boy sits on the Iron Throne A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it Theyve never been more vulnerable
daenerys	You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth I didnt listen That all worked out well
daenerys	How can I rule seven kingdoms if I cant control Slavers Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
jorah	Youre a Targaryen Youre the Mother of Dragons
daenerys	I need to be more than that I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains I will not sail for Westeros
jorah	What, then?
daenerys	I will do what queens do I will rule Outside the Aerie
littlefinger	Pull up your hood A memorable shade
sansa	But how would they know?
littlefinger	You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls theyll never meet
sansa	Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
littlefinger	The mountains are impassable If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate It doesnt matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats The first Lords of the Vale didnt have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them And the fortress they built here has never been overcome Not once in 1,000 years Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000
knight	Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
littlefinger	Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne
knight	Stand to
knight	Stand to
knight	Stand to
knight	Welcome back, Lord Baelish
robin	Uncle Petyr
littlefinger	My lord
littlefinger	Oh I have brought you a gift
lysa	Lord Baelish
littlefinger	My lady
robin	Look what Uncle Petyr brought me
lysa	A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy
sansa	Its a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn My name is Al.
lysa	Oh, do take down that hood, child Dont you think know who you are? You think Id let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me
lysa	My flesh and blood
sansa	Its wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa
lysa	You mustnt call me that in front of anyone else
sansa	Of course I understand
lysa	No one can know youre here It would put us in a very precarious position
sansa	I would never say a thing
lysa	The Lannisters want to destroy us Theyve been trying for years Now they know what it feels like
robin	Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brothers head
sansa	They did, and my fathers
robin	They killed my father, too, with poison I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldnt
sansa	Make him fly?
robin	Through the Moon Door
lysa	And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll
sansa	They did They made us both Lord Tyrion didnt want to
lysa	I dont believe that for a moment Did he force himself on you?
sansa	No We never.
lysa	Good Robin, this is your cousin Sansa But youre not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin
sansa	Its a pleasure to meet you, Robin
lysa	Robin, show Sansa to her chamber Take the back stairs
littlefinger	Go Well speak soon
lysa	What took you so long?
littlefinger	Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive
lysa	Shes here Weve spent more than enough time on her for one evening
lysa	Lets get married tonight
littlefinger	Ought we not inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
lysa	Theres only one Lord of the Vale The others can all hang Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me
littlefinger	I do think that we could wait until.
lysa	Im done waiting, Petyr We had our wedding night many years ago Or dont you remember?
littlefinger	Like it was yesterday
lysa	What wife would do for you the things Ive done for you? What wife would trust you the way Ive trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jons wine, my husbands wine when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters.
littlefinger	The deed is done Faded into nothing Only speaking of it can make it real
littlefinger	Tonight it is, then
littlefinger	Let me bathe and dress for the occasion Once Im presentable, Ill call on the septon immediately
lysa	Im warning you Im going to scream when my husband makes love to me Im going to scream so loud, theyll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea
tywin	When will the wedding take place in your mind?
cersei	As soon as decency permits After weve allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband
tywin	A fortnight?
cersei	That seems reasonable
tywin	No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals
tywin	And your wedding to Loras?
cersei	Shortly after Tommens
tywin	Shortly?
cersei	A fortnight
tywin	I know you dont like them I didnt like your husband Used to pat me on the back a lot I didnt trust him
cersei	We had that in common
tywin	You dont need to make formal alliances with people you trust
cersei	Then whom can we trust?
tywin	Ourselves alone
tywin	The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side
cersei	Robert wasnt particularly rich
tywin	Robert had me funding him Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth
cersei	I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one
tywin	Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
cersei	Havent a clue
tywin	Go on, your best guess
cersei	Pounds, tons, ounces?
tywin	Doesnt matter The answer is the same
cersei	That cant be
tywin	Our last working mine ran dry three years ago
cersei	Then how do we pay for anything?
tywin	The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money
cersei	How much?
tywin	A tremendous amount
cersei	There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement
tywin	The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank There is no someone
cersei	Someone does work there It is comprised of people
tywin	And a temple is comprised of stones One stone crumbles and another takes its place And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more Thats what the Iron Bank is a temple We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it You cant run from them You cant cheat them You cant sway them with excuses If you owe them money and you dont want to crumble yourself, you pay it back Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect
cersei	Its for the good of the family, I understand that Im not sure my brothers do
tywin	I know youre building a strong case against Tyrion And as a mother, that is your right But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you
cersei	I respect that We dont need to discuss it
cersei	The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters Youve started wars to protect this family Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
arya	Joffrey Cersei Walder Frey Meryn Trant Tywin Lannister The Red Woman Beric Dondarrion Thoros of Myr Ilyn Payne The Mountain
sandor	Would you shut up?
arya	I cant sleep until I say the names
sandor	The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
arya	Only the ones Im going to kill
sandor	Hates as good a thing as any to keep a person going Better than most We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list
arya	If he were here right now, what would you do?
sandor	Id tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men
arya	Im almost done Only one name left
sandor	Go on
arya	The Hound
sansa	Thank you
lysa	Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?
sansa	Really?
lysa	Oh, yes At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard Anything sweet Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals Cat was the firstborn daughter after all It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat
sansa	My mother fat? She never let me have my pudding until Id finished all my proper food
lysa	This is before she married your father and moved to the North By the time you were born, your fathers austerity had become hers Marriage changes people I didnt mean for you to stop Go on, enjoy them How do you like them?
sansa	Theyre delicious Where did you get the lemons? You cant grow them up here
lysa	Oh, gods, no Petyr had three crates brought all the way from Kings Landing He knew you liked lemon cakes Hes so kind He really cares for you Think where youd be without him In their clutches and tried for murder
sansa	Yes Im very lucky
lysa	He feels responsible for you
sansa	Oh, I know he does Im so grateful
lysa	Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
sansa	Well, Im half Tully He loved your family so much
lysa	Loved your mother
sansa	No
lysa	Thats what you wanted to say
sansa	He loves you, Aunt Lysa Hes married to you
lysa	Your mother never loved him Never Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing The most obvious thing Your Uncle Brandon Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon He almost killed Petyr in a duel And your mother loved him anyway And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didnt love him no more than those whores in his brothels Has he told you about them?
sansa	No
lysa	He hasnt told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
sansa	No, never
lysa	Are you pregnant?
sansa	What? No, I told you Lord Tyrion and I never.
lysa	I wasnt asking about Tyrion What have you let Petyr do with your body?
sansa	Aunt Lysa, no, I.
lysa	Your young, pretty body
sansa	Nothing Im a virgin
lysa	Dont lie to me
sansa	Youre hurting me
lysa	Ill know if you lie
sansa	Im a virgin, I swear it He loves you, Aunt Lysa All he says is that Im stupid Im a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and Im a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth And I swear to you that he has never touched me Not once, not ever
lysa	Shh Shh Shh Its all right It will all be all right Youll be a widow soon Theyll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and youll be free to marry Robin Youll be the Lady of the Vale Hmm ingsroad
brienne	Didnt they teach you how to ride a horse?
podrick	Yes, my lady, when I was young There wasnt much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though He preferred litters
brienne	Perhaps you should have stayed with him Its not going to be a pleasant journey for you It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather
podrick	Thats a long way off
brienne	Well, Lady Sansas brothers at Castle Black If I were her, thats where Id go Feel free to stop at any point
podrick	Never, my lady Im your squire
brienne	Ive made it this far in the world without a squire I dont see why I need one now
podrick	All knights have squires, my lady
brienne	Im not a knight And Im not a slaver, either I dont own you
podrick	I swore an oath, my lady
brienne	I am releasing you from that oath That means you could leave
podrick	I know
brienne	What do you think will happen if you leave?
podrick	Theyll say I wasnt a very good squire
sandor	The hell you doing?
arya	Practicing
sandor	What, ways to die?
arya	No ones going to kill me
sandor	They will if you Nance around like that Thats no way to fight
arya	Its not fighting Its water dancing
sandor	Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress Who taught you that shite?
arya	The greatest swordsman who ever lived Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos
sandor	Braavos Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet They all are
arya	What do you know about anything?
sandor	I bet his hair is greasier than Joffreys cunt

sandor	How?
arya	He was killed
sandor	Who by?
arya	Meryn Trant Thats why
sandor	Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
arya	He was outnumbered
sandor	Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants
arya	Syrio didnt have a sword Or armor Just a stick
sandor	The greatest swordsman who ever lived didnt have a sword? All right You have a sword Lets see what he taught you Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend Dead like all the rest of your friends

oberyn	Which joke is that?
cersei	Youre a prince of Dorne A legendary fighter A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros But you could not save your sister Im a Lannister Queen for 19 years Daughter of the most powerful man alive But I could not save my son What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?

davos	Your Grace, if youd like to sit, Im sure that-
stannis	Weve been here since midday
davos	Easterners have a difference sense of time, Ive often found Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest-
tycho	Welcome to the Iron Bank Please, sit
tycho	What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
davos	This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
tycho	The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
stannis	He shares no blood with me He is a bastard born of incest As was his brother before him
tycho	Yes, we have heard this story
stannis	Its not a story Its the truth
tycho	The kings grandfather tells a different story A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold
stannis	Gold you loaned him
tycho	And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
stannis	More than any man living
tycho	Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like usurper and madman and blood right Here, our books are filled with numbers We prefer the stories they tell More plain Less open to interpretation How many fighting men remain loyal to you?
stannis	4
tycho	And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay
davos	32
tycho	And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?
stannis	None
tycho	You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective Im afraid we must respectfully decline your request But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit
davos	My lord
tycho	Im not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth You would not be either here In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles
davos	Well, strictly speaking, I didnt do the thieving That would be the pirates I just moved what they stole from one place to another {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers
davos	This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes I consider it an honest accounting Hes an honest man and hes your best chance to get back the money youve sunk into Westeros Which is a lot, I imagine Wars are expensive
tycho	The war is over
davos	As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over Whos the real power in Kings Landing?
tycho	Ser Davos.
davos	Humor me
tycho	Tywin Lannister
dav os	How old is Tywin Lannister?
tycho	67
stannis	67 And when he dies, whos in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywins gone, who do you back?
tycho	That is a problem for another time
davos	Begging your pardon, I think its a problem for now Theres only one reliable leader left in Westeros Stannis Hes got the birthright Hes in his prime Hes a tried and tested battle commander And he doesnt just talk about paying people back, he does it
sallador	The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way The captain shouts to his first mate, Bring me my red shirt The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory A few days later, the lookout screams, Two pirate ships! The crew is shivering like scared mice But the courageous captain hollers, Bring me my red shirt!
sallador	After the battle, the first mate asks, Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle? The captain replies, So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed The next morning the lookout screams, 10 pirate ships! We are surrounded! The crew goes silent
sallador	They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command Calm as ever, the captain bellows.
women	Bring me my brown pants!
davos	You think they ever met a pirate who didnt tell them that joke?
sallador	Davos I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone
davos	Only half rotted
sallador	Join us, my friend Join us This is Lhara And this is-
lhara	I am Lhara
sallador	Shes an artist, this one, truly
davos	No time, Im afraid We sail at sunrise
sallador	We?
davos	You, me we
sallador	Once I thought this man loved me Now I know he despises me He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold-
davos	You wont be alone And you wont be poor
davos	Theres a chest of the good stuff left back at your house I gave it to your wife
sallador	Youre not my friend, my friend
davos	Ill see you at sunrise

ramsay	Theon Greyjoy
daenerys	You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons Dont be afraid, my friend
missandei	The Queen says you may approach and speak
missandei	He is a goatherd He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters
daenerys	I thank him for his prayers
missandei	It was your dragons, he says They came this morning for his flock
missandei	He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing
daenerys	Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship I cannot bring back his goats
daenerys	but I will see he is paid their value three times over
daenerys	Send the next one in
manservant	The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen
daenerys	The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself
hizdahr	Queen Daenerys Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated
daenerys	I thank you
hizdahr	Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen
daenerys	Then it is my honor to receive you
hizdahr	My father, one of Meereens most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks This pyramid included
daenerys	For that, he has my gratitude I should be honored to meet him
hizdahr	You have, Your Grace You crucified him I pray youll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly
daenerys	Your father crucified innocent children
hizdahr	My father spoke out against crucifying those children He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled Is it justice to answer one crime with another?
daenerys	I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime Youd be wise to remember that
hizdahr	Whats done is done You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated
daenerys	And what traditions do you speak of?
hizdahr	The tradition of funeral rite Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun
hizdahr	Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials
daenerys	And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
hizdahr	Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father Let me take his body down Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world
daenerys	Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq
hizdahr	Thank you, my queen
daenerys	How many more?
missandei	There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace
daenerys	212?
daenerys	Send the next one in
oberyn	These meetings arent always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?
mace	Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you-
mace	Lord Tywin, its a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council I-
tywin	The trial begins this afternoon We only have the morning for affairs of state Shall we begin?
varys	Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord
cersei	A coward and a traitor
varys	My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers I believe the phrase fuck the king was uttered
pycelle	Disgraceful
tywin	What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
varys	10 silver stags seems a generous bounty
tywin	Make it 100 What else?
varys	More whispers from the east, my lord
tywin	The Targaryen girl?
varys	Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen She has conquered the city and rules as its queen
cersei	Conquered with what?
varys	She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen Some 8,000 strong She has a company of sellswords the Second Sons She has two knights advising her Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy And she has three dragons
cersei	Baby dragons Larger every year, Your Grace
pycelle	Mormont is spying on her for us
varys	No longer He appears to be fully devoted to her As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated
cersei	Hes an old man He wasnt fit to protect my son
tywin	Joffrey didnt die on his watch Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid
cersei	Dont tell me youre worried about a child halfway across the world
varys	A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace
oberyn	Lord Varys is right I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand They are very impressive on the battlefield Less so in the bedroom
tywin	Dragons havent won a war in 300 years Armies win them all the time She must be dealt with
pycelle	How, my lord? By force?
tywin	Eventually, if it comes to that Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
varys	Most certainly, my Lord Hand
tywin	Mmm Lord Tyrell, be a good man Fetch my quill and paper
varys	Prince Oberyn
oberyn	Lord Varys.
varys	Only Varys Im not actually a nobleman No one is under obligation to call me lord
oberyn	And yet everyone does
varys	You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied Did you spend much time in Essos?
oberyn	Five years
varys	May I ask why?
oberyn	Tis a big and beautiful world Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it I dont want to be most of us
varys	Most of us arent princes
oberyn	You are from Essos Where? Lys?
varys	I have an ear for accents Ive lost my accent entirely
oberyn	I have an ear for that as well How did you get here?
varys	Its a long story
oberyn	One you dont like telling people
varys	People I trust
oberyn	My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting You should come to the brothel and meet her We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here We have some lovely boys on retainer, but.
oberyn	You did like boys before?
oberyn	Really? Girls? Hmm I hope you wont be offended when I say I never would have guessed
varys	Not at all But I was never interested in girls, either
oberyn	What then?
varys	Nothing
oberyn	Everybody is interested in something
varys	Not me When I see what desire does to people, what its done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things
oberyn	Such as?
tyrion	Let me guess, Ive been pardoned
tyrion	Really?
jaime	Fathers orders
tyrion	Well, we mustnt disappoint Father , the Iron Throne room
man	Kingslayer
tommen	I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell And if found guilty may the gods punish the accused
tywin	Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide Did you kill King Joffrey?
tyrion	No
tywin	Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
tyrion	Not that I know of
tywin	How would you say he died, then?
tyrion	Choked on his pigeon pie
tywin	So you would blame the bakers?
tyrion	Or the pigeons Just leave me out of it
twyin	The crown may call its first witness
meryn trant	Once wed got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool It wasnt the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested hed meet the same fate And when I spoke in the kings defense, he threatened to have me killed
tyrion	Oh, why dont you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
tywin	Silence
tyrion	Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her
tywin	Silence! You will not speak unless called upon Youre dismissed
pycelle	Basilisk venom, widows blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demons dance blind eye-
oberyn	I think you have made your point, Grand Maester You have a lot of poison in your store
pycelle	Had, Prince Oberyn My stores were plundered
tywin	By whom?
pycelle	By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned
tywin	Grand Maester, you examined King Joffreys corpse Was it without question poison that killed him?
pycelle	Without question
pycelle	This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the kings fool He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast She wore this necklace the day of the wedding Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside
tywin	Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
pyelle	It was The Strangler A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth
cersei	I will hurt you for this A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid
mace	Your own brother said this to you?
cersei	Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements He believed his presence would inspire the troops
oberyn	Tyrion said, And you will know the debt is paid What debt?
cersei	I discovered hed been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs He wasnt pleased
tywin	Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony
mace	Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
varys	Im afraid I do, my lord He said, Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies
mace	And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
varys	Yes After we received word of Robb Starks death He didnt seem gladdened by the news Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause
twyin	Youre excused, Lord Varys
tyrion	Father, may I ask the witness one question?
tywin	One
tyrion	You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
varys	Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing
tywin	We will adjourn for now
tywin	Toll the bells in an hours time
guard	Clear the court
jaime	Youd condemn your own son to death?
tywin	Ive condemned no one The trial is not over
jaime	This isnt a trial Its a farce Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it
tywin	I know nothing of the sort
jaime	Youve always hated Tyrion
tywin	He killed his king
jaime	As did I Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
tywin	It wont be murder Itll be justice
jaime	Justice?
tywin	Im performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly
jaime	Hell be executed
tywin	No, hell be punished accordingly
jaime	Once you said family is what lives on All that lives on You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? Im a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line
tywin	Im well aware of your oath
jaime	What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I dont even remember?
tywin	What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandsons killer?
jaime	It survives through me Ill leave the Kingsguard Ill take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live
tywin	Done
tywin	When the testimonys concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak Hell plead for mercy Ill allow him to join the Nights Watch In three days time, hell depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall Youll remove your white cloak immediately You will leave Kings Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister And youll never turn your back on your family again
jaime	You have my word
tywin	And you have mine -
tyrion	Not going well, is it?
jaime	Youre going to be found guilty
tyrion	Oh, you think so?
jaime	When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall Fathers agreed to it Hell spare your life and allow you to join the Nights Watch
tyriom	Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out
jaime	Father is not Joffrey Hell keep his word
tyrion	How do you know?
jaime	Do you trust me?
jaime	Keep your mouth shut No more outbursts This will all be over soon
tywin	The crown may call its next witness
tywin	State your name
shae	Shae
tywin	Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
shae	I swear it
tywin	Do you know this man?
shae	Yes Tyrion Lannister
tywin	How do you know him?
shae	I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa
tywin	This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey What do you know of this?
shae	I know that hes guilty
shae	He and Sansa planned it together
tywin	Silence! Continue
shae	She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother She blamed their deaths on the king Tyrion was happy to help He hated Joffrey He hated the queen He hated you, my lord
shae	He stole poison from the Grand Maesters chamber to put in Joffreys wine
oberyn	How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wifes maid?
shae	I wasnt just her maid I was his whore
mace	I beg your pardon? You said you were his.
shae	His whore
tywin	How did you come to be in his service?
shae	He stole me I was with another man, a knight in your lordships army But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent He broke the knights arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion You belong to me now, he said I want you to fuck me like its my last night in this world
tywin	Silence Silence
oberyn	And did you?
shae	Did I what?
oberyn	Fuck him like it was his last night in this world
shae	I did everything he wanted Whatever he told me to do to him Whatever he felt like doing to me I kissed him where he wanted I licked him where he wanted I let him put himself where he wanted I was his property I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored He ordered me to call him my lion, so I did I took his face in my hands and said, I am yours and you are mine
tyrion	Shae Please dont
shae	I am a whore Remember? That was before he married Sansa After that, all he wanted was her But she wouldnt let him into her bed So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her
tyrion	Father, I wish to confess I wish to confess
tywin	You wish to confess?
tyrion	I saved you I saved this city and all your worthless lives I should have let Stannis kill you all
tywin	Tyrion Do you wish to confess?
tyrion	Yes, Father Im guilty Guilty Is that what you want to hear?
tywin	You admit you poisoned the king?
tyrion	No, of that Im innocent Im guilty of a far more monstrous crime I am guilty of being a dwarf
tywin	You are not on trial for being a dwarf
tyrion	Oh, yes, I am Ive been on trial for that my entire life
tywin	Have you nothing to say in your defense?
tyrion	Nothing but this I did not do it I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had
tyrion	Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores
tyrion	I wish I was the monster you think I am I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it
tywin	Escort the prisoner back to his cell
jaime	I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer
tyrion	Im sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?
jaime	You threw your life away You threw it away Its not a joke You understand that, dont you?
tyrion	Of course its a joke, just not a very funny one I couldnt I couldnt listen to her standing there telling her lies I couldnt do it
jaime	You fell in love with a whore
tyrion	Yes, I fell in love with a whore And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted You do see that? He gets you back as his heir The future Lord of the Rock And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last All so perfect It felt good to take that from him He knows Im innocent and hes willing to sacrifice me anyway Hes willing to sacrifice any of us Not you Youre the golden son You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, youll always be the golden son
jaime	Careful Im the last friend youve got
tyrion	At least I got to tell them what they really are
jaime	Yes, brilliant speech Theyll be talking about it for days to come I thought you were a realist Didnt realize youd die for pride
tyrion	Dont give up on me just yet I survived one trial by combat, even though you werent there to save me
jaime	I cant save you this time either My training has proved that I cant beat a stable boy with my left hand
tyrion	Wheres your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Fathers face when you fall
tyrion	Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword
jaime	It is tempting
tyrion	Well Bronn fought for me once, hell do it again If he wins, I expect Ill be in his debt for the rest of my life
jaime	If he wins
tyrion	Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope its Ser Meryn Trant Id enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater
jaime	No
not guard	Go on, move it
guard	And you Come on

jon	Greetings
man	Didnt think Id see you again
sam	All right, Jon?
man	Welcome back, brother
alliser	Lord Snow
alliser	This is no place for wild beasts Lock him away or Ill let Hobb throw him in tonights stew
jon	Come on, Ghost
jon	Mances army was closing in on Crasters Keep when we left We saw their campfires from Osrics Hill Theyll reach the Wall before the next full moon
janos slynt	Im surprised you didnt ride over and say hello ing-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isnt he?
jon	We need to prepare
alliser	Weve been preparing
jon	We should seal the tunnel Plug it with rocks and ice Flood it and let it freeze
alliser	And how would we range north?
jon	We wouldnt
alliser	Coward You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?
grenn	We cant defend the gate against 100,000 men
alliser	This castle has stood for thousands of years The Nights Watch has defended her for thousands of years And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel
jon	Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have
alliser	The bars on those gates are four inches thick Cold-rolled steel
jon	They wont stop them
alliser	Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow
jon	The stewards
alliser	Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
jon	No
alliser	Who would that be?
jon	The builders
alliser	Ah, the builders First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Nights Watch Do you agree with him?
yarwick	No
alliser	Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon
alliser	Moving on First Builder, well need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall
yarwick	Aye
bronn	My lord
tyrion	You have new clothes
bronn	Do you like em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin Softer than a virgins thighs
tyrion	I sent for you days ago
bronn	Ive been a bit busy
tyrion	Doing what?
bronn	My lonesome bachelor days are over Im to wed Lollys Stokeworth
tyrion	Lollys Stokeworth? She doesnt strike me as your sort of girl
bronn	I wouldnt say I had a single sort of girl
tyrion	Shes dim-witted
bronn	If I wanted wits, Id marry you
tyrion	When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?
bronn	Falyse Aye, I did know about the older sister
tyrion	And you understand the rules of inheritance?
bronn	Falyse is 40 and barren
tyrion	She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies
bronn	She does Unless she happens to perish before her father Then Lollys gets the castle
bronn	What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time
tyrion	You and my sister deserve each other Why did you bother to come here?
bronn	You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, youd double their price
tyrion	Is it two wives you want or two castles?
bronn	One of each will do But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, itd better be a damn big castle
tyrion	Im a bit short on castles at the moment But I can offer you gold and gratitude
bronn	I have gold What can I buy with gratitude?
tyrion	You might be surprised A Lannister always pays his debts
bronn	Your sisters a Lannister, too
tyrion	My wife is heir to Winterfell If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name I could carve you out a big piece of it
bronn	If and may and could Its bloody cold up north Lollys is soft and warm And close If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, youd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink
tyrion	Does he frighten you so much?
bronn	Id be a bloody fool if he didnt frighten me Hes freakish big and freakish strong And quicker than youd expect for a man of that size Maybe I could take him, dance around until hes so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow But one misstep and Im dead Why should I risk it?
tyrion	Because youre my friend
bronn	Aye, Im your friend And when have you ever risked your life for me?
bronn	I like you, pampered little shit that you are I just like myself more
tyrion	I understand
bronn	Im sorry it has to be this way
tyrion	Why are you sorry? Because youre an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? Thats what I liked about you in the first place
bronn	We had some good days together
tyrion	Yes, we did
bronn	What will you do?
tyrion	I suppose Ill have to kill the Mountain myself Wont that make for a great song?
bronn	I hope to hear them sing it one day
daenerys	How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded
daario	but your window is not
daario	I swam to an island a mile offshore for these
daenerys	Dont do that again
daario	Never met a woman who didnt like wildflowers
daenerys	These are my private quarters If I want you here, I will summon you
daario	Forgive me, my queen I live to serve you
daenerys	Tell me why youre here
daario	I came to ask a favor I only have two talents in this world war and women You are staying here in Meereen to rule That is a wise decision I respect it But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents
daenerys	Ive ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing
daario	Youve ordered us to be night watchmen
daenerys	And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue
daario	There is only one, and she does not want me
daenerys	You swore me your sword
daario	My sword is yours till the day I die
daenerys	So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
daario	Ill stay in Meereen and patrol the streets Send me to kill your enemies Any enemy anywhere Let me do what I do best
daenerys	Very well
daenerys	Do what you do best
daenerys	Take off your clothes
selyse	Oh
melisandre	Come in, my queen Please
selyse	I didnt mean to disturb you, my lady
melisandre	You could never disturb me
selyse	I just wanted to speak with you before we left
melisandre	Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one
melisandre	No, no, no Not that one You dont even want to touch that one Next to it Thats the one
melisandre	When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me He said, Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while Make it count A joke Not a very good one, Im afraid
selyse	It was I humor isnt my strength
melisandre	Thats because most jokes are lies and youre devoted to the truth
selyse	If theyre lies, my lady, arent they best avoided?
melisandre	Not always
melisandre	Most of these powders and potions are lies Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lords power Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was a trick that lead them to the truth A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear And a drop of this in any mans wine will drive him wild with lust
selyse	Did you use it with Stannis?
melisandre	No Dont be upset Men never crave what they already have
melisandre	Its only flesh It needs what it needs
selyse	No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin I thank God every day for bringing you to us And Stannis to you He wants to bring Shireen with us I think that would be ill-advised My daughter has heretical tendencies, as youre well aware I dont know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home
melisandre	I understand how you feel
selyse	Hmm
melisandre	But that is impossible
selyse	Why?
melisandre	You dont need powders and potions, my queen You dont need lies You are strong enough to look into the Lords light and see his truth for yourself
melisandre	However harsh it is However hard for us to understand You dont need my help, but I will need yours soon When we set sail, your daughter must be with us The Lord needs her
daario	Jorah the Andal Are you here to see our queen? Shes in a good mood
jorah	Khaleesi
daenerys	Youre here early
jorah	Later than some
daenerys	You dont approve?
jorah	Its not a question of approval, its a question of trust
daenerys	You neither approve nor trust
jorah	Why would I? The mans a sellsword
daenerys	Didnt you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
jorah	I did
daenerys	I trust you
jorah	Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
daenerys	I could never have faith in a man like Daario Thats why Ive sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai
jorah	You have?
daenerys	I have
jorah	Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control
daenerys	That is why Ive ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai The masters tear babies from their mothers arms They mutilate little boys by the thousands They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself
jorah	Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts The slaves you freed, brutality is all theyve ever known If you want them to know something else, youll have to show it to them
daenerys	And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
jorah	Its tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but theres good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought
daenerys	Let the priests argue over good and evil Slavery is real I can end it I will end it And I will end those behind it
jorah	I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi
daenerys	And now you are helping me show them to freedom
jorah	I wouldnt be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai
daenerys	The man who came to me the other day about burying his father
jorah	Hizdahr zo Loraq?
daenerys	He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen He will explain the choice they have before them They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one
daenerys	Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves Tell him I changed my mind
jorah	Yes, Khaleesi
daenerys	No Tell him you changed my mind
sandor	Rat cunts Fucking whore
arya	Youre doing it wrong You need to burn away that horrible bit there Otherwise its gonna get infected and fester I know you dont like fire, but if you dont do it right-
sandor	No fire
arya	Itll only take a second It wont hurt that much
sandor	No fire
sandor	Shut up about it Shut up about everything Thanks to you, Im a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway Which is everywhere between where we are now and where were going
sandor	Im as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten No reward is worth this much trouble Wish Id never laid eyes on you You say your brother gave you that sword
sandor	My brother gave me this It was just like you said a while back Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop
arya	Why?
sandor	Thought I stole one of his toys I didnt steal it I was just playing with it The pain was bad The smell was worse But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it My father, who protected him told everyone my bedding caught fire You think youre on your own?
arya	Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least
brienne	Bit of comfort never hurt anyone Weve been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you
podrick	Couldnt agree more, my lady
brienne	Just dont start expecting silk underclothes Not working for your former lord any longer
podrick	Yes, my lady
brienne	Dont get drunk
podrick	No, my lady
hot pie	Can I get you anything else?
brienne	No, this will do nicely, thank you Kidney pie is wonderful
hot pie	Thanks I do my best
hot pie	A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk Easy enough But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves kidneys is not easy I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys Got no right to cook anything, them Oh, and the gravy Dont get me started on the gravy Very difficult to get right See, a lot of people give up on the gravy You cannot give up on the gravy No gravy, no pie Simple as that Thats nice armor Are you a knight?
brienne	No
hot pie	Oh, its just people with armor are usually knights Generally speaking From Kings Landing, though, arent you? From there myself originally Flea Bottom born and bred What brings you to these parts?
brienne	Were looking for someone
hot pie	Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here A lot of people come in here Just the other day we had 17-
brienne	A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name
hot pie	Starks? What, like them lot from Winterhell ?
hot pie	sNo, aint seen anyone like that I heard they was all traitors Dont need no traitors in here
brienne	I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark I swore to her Id bring her daughters home
hot pie	Sure I cant get you a bit more kidney pie?
brienne	What?
podrick	Its nothing, my lady
brienne	You wouldnt be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing
podrick	Dont want to offend, my lady Truly, I dont
brienne	Youre not interesting enough to be offensive
podrick	The Lannisters want Lady Sansa The Lannisters have money People kill for money I dont think we should be telling people were searching for Lady Sansa
hot pie	My lady My lord Could I have a word?
brienne	What about? Not kidney pie
hot pie	You seem like a proper lady Someone who could be trusted I never met no Sansa Stark But I know her sister Arya
brienne	No ones seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded Shes presumed dead
hot pie	She werent when I last spoke to her
brienne	When was that?
hot pie	Heading up north with the Nights Watch She was all dressed up as a boy Like your ladyship, only without the armor Going by the name Arry
brienne	So what happened to her?
hot pie	Well-
brienne	The quick version
hot pie	The Lannisters took us prisoner We escaped The Brotherhood took us prisoner They sold me to the innkeep They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner Big ugly fellow Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham Not friendly
podrick	The Hound
hot pie	Thats the one If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better
brienne	Um, you were saying?
ings road brienne	Her mothers dead, grandfathers dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun The Brotherhood isnt going to Riverrun
podrick	Theyll take her to the Eyrie, my lady
brienne	Why the Eyrie?
podrick	Her aunt, Lysa Arryn Catelyn Starks sister Shes Aryas last living relative with money She hates the Lannisters Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who
brienne	Sansa could be there, too
podrick	Aye, my lady Could be
brienne	You sure about this?
podrick	No
tyrion	I imagined youd be back at the brothel at this hour
oberyn	I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day
tyrion	Mm, do tell Ive got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like
oberyn	Your sister
tyrion	Oh
oberyn	Cersei approached me We spoke a great deal about her daughter How worried your sister is about her She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you I think she may have even believed it herself
tyrion	Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts
oberyn	It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters She desperately wants to see you killed
tyrion	She didnt need to bother you It looks as though Ive taken care of that myself The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck Shes wanted this for a long time
oberyn	Yes, I know We met, you and I Many years ago
tyrion	I think I would have remembered that
oberyn	Unlikely You had just been born Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock My first time away from Dorne I didnt like anything about the Rock Not the food, not the weather, your accents Nothing But the biggest disappointment you
tyrion	You and my family have more in common than you might admit
oberyn	The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy
tyrion	That would have made things so much easier
oberyn	When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us Every day we would ask Every day she would say, Soon Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak Your head was a bit large Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw No red eye No tail between your legs Just a tiny pink cock We didnt try to hide our disappointment Thats not a monster, I told Cersei Thats just a baby And she said, He killed my mother And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off Until your brother made her stop It doesnt matter, she told us Everyone says he will die soon I hope they are right He should not have lived this long
tyrion	Well sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants
oberyn	And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children
tyrion	If you want justice, youve come to the wrong place
oberyn	I disagree
oberyn	Ive come to the perfect place I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice And all those who have wronged me are right here I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sisters children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too I will be your champion
sansa	Hello, Robin
robin	What are you doing?
sansa	Im building my home, Winterfell At least I think I am I havent been back there in a very long time
robin	Why did you leave?
sansa	Its a long story

robin	Oh Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
sansa	No, Im afraid not Its not high up in the mountains Its down on the ground
robin	That sounds dangerous How do you make people fly?
sansa	We dont
robin	What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you dont like?
sansa	I never did anything with them at all Girls didnt take part in that where I came from
robin	Well, Im Lord of the Vale When I grow up, Ill be able to fly anybody who bothers me Or you When we get married, you can tell me if you dont like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door
sansa	I like the sound of that
robin	Lets put a Moon Door in your Winterfell
sansa	All right
robin	It can go in here in this big tower
sansa	Careful Youve ruined it Now Im going to have to rebuild the whole thing
robin	I didnt ruin it
sansa	You did
robin	It was already ruined because it didnt have a Moon Door I was fixing it
sansa	Knocking things down isnt fixing them Its ruining them
robin	I didnt ruin it
sansa	Youre being stupid
robin	I didnt ruin it
sansa	Robin, Im sorry, I-
littlefinger	Children

littlefinger	Let me worry about Aunt Lysa
sansa	I was trying to remember what everything looked like Ill never see it again
littlefinger	A lot can happen between now and never If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one
sansa	Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why
littlefinger	I loved your mother more than you could ever know Given the opportunity, what do we do to those whove hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child But we dont live in that world
littlefinger	Youre more beautiful than she ever was
sansa	Lord Baelish.
littlefinger	Call me Petyr
sansa	You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?
lysa	Come here, Sansa
lysa	Do you know how far the fall is?
sansa	No
lysa	Neither do I, precisely Hundreds of feet Its fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height The impact breaks them right apart Like eggs dropped on the floor Sometimes pieces remain intact Youll find the head sitting on its own Every hair in place Blue eyes staring at nothing I know what you did
sansa	Im so sorry, Aunt Lysa I never should have hit Robin, I know it I promise it wont happen-
lysa	Dont be coy with me, you little whore You kissed him You kissed Petyr
sansa	I didnt You dont understand
lysa	I saw you! You cant lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes
sansa	He kissed me I pulled away
lysa	Liar! Whore! He is mine
sansa	Please
lysa	My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now theyre all dead Thats what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down
littlefinger	Lysa! Let her go
lysa	You want her? This empty-headed child?
littlefinger	Let her go
lysa	Shes just like her mother Shell never love you I lied for you I killed for you Why did you bring her here? Why?

ramsay	Bracken Mmm, strong As long as theyre in the see But when you take them out of the water, no bones They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing Youd think theyd know that Unfortunately theyre not very bright What do you tell them?
theon	Im Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands
ramsay	And what are you really?
theon	Im Reek
ramsay	Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord Formidable, proud
theon	Im Reek
ramsay	Until when?

guard	  No closer Who are you?
ralf	Im Kenning, commander of this garrison And you say youre Theon Greyjoy?
theon	Yes
ralf	And why should I believe that?
theon	I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy His third and last-living son I am your prince I swear it by the drowned god What is dead may never die
everyone	What is dead may never die
ralf	And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?
theon	Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn
ralf	And what does Lord Bolton want?
theon	You are fading from sickness You are badly outnumbered and youre hundreds of miles from the sea Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore
ralf	He wants us to surrender?
theon	My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon I watched him bend the knee There was no shame there He fought with honor, as did you
ralf	shame fought with honor

theon	Yes mlord Will we go home now?
ramsay	I believe we will To our new home
cut to	THE VALE You have foreign blood, dont you, Baelish?
littlefinger	A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally
lord royce	Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago Weve fought off invaders ever since
littlefinger	The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce
lord royce	She told me nothing about you, Baelish But I didnt need to hear from her Moneylender Whoremonger Youve been licking Tywin Lannisters boots so long, its a wonder your tongues not black
littlefinger	My lord.
lord royce	And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared Always been a grubby job Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn.
littlefinger	Lady Arryn invited me She and I have been close since childhood
lady anya	Yes, we all know how close you were Lady Arryns predilections were her own affair Her death is our affair
littlefinger	Of course Her suicide shattered us all
lady anya	She was an odd fish Everyone knew that But suicide? She adored that boy of hers I dont see her abandoning him Not by choice
lord royce	Strange that within days of your arrival, youve married Lady Arryn and shes fallen through the Moon Door
littlefinger	She was always prone to melancholy My lady wasnt meant for a world as brutal as ours
lord royce	We were told there was a witness A girl
lady anya	A niece of yours, I believe
littlefinger	A girl with no learning and scattered wits I assure you, she would be of no help
lord royce	Wed like to speak with her
littlefinger	Let me fetch her
lady anya	No need We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated
lady anya	Come closer, child You have nothing to fear from us or him Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room
littlefinger	My lady.
lady anya	I wasnt asking you
sansa	He can stay
lord royce	Speak up, girl, youre not a damn kitchen mouse Tell us what you saw
sansa	  Im sorry, Lord Baelish I have to tell the truth  council tell you everything
lady anya	Please, Alayne, leave nothing out
sansa	My name is not Alayne Its Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall
lord royce	Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?
sansa	Lord Baelish has told many lies All to protect me Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in Kings Landing A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp I had no friends in Kings Landing except one He saved me Smuggled me away when he had the chance He knew Id be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa The Lannisters have friends everywhere Even the Vale He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name
ser vance	Your secret is safe with us, my lady
lord royce	Your father grew up right here in these halls We hunted together many times He was a fine man
lady anya	Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa
sansa	You knew her well, my lords, my lady You knew she was a troubled woman She always loved Lord Baelish She told me herself From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy For a time My aunt was a jealous lady She was terrified that Lord Baelish didnt love her anymore That he would abandon her for a younger woman And then one day she saw him kiss me
lord royce	Lady Sansa
sansa	It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage Hes always been so kind to me I was so happy to be here, to be free All because of him But my aunt turned on me She cursed me Called me a whore Promised to throw me through the Moon Door When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him She said she didnt want to live anymore She stood on the edge of that Moon Door He tried to reason with her Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was  
lady anya	Shh Shh, its not your fault, sweet girl Its not your fault
lord royce	You could see it in the way she raised that boy Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old
lady anya	Lord Royce! This is hardly the time
lord royce	Apologies, my lady And to you as well, Baelish We treated you a bit harshly
littlefinger	You want justice, Lord Royce I can hardly complain about that I want the same
lady anya	Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?
littlefinger	For Lysa, no But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon They fought together to overcome the Mad King And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner A timid boy at a tavern brawl
lord royce	Are you questioning our courage?
littlefinger	I want to know which side youre on Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?
lord royce	Of course we dont support the damn Lannisters
littlefinger	No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused By staying out of the fray, youve allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point Who stands against him now?
lady anya	Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead
littlefinger	Id have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale
lady anya	Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy
littlefinger	And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men
lady anya	More often they die young
littlefinger	I adored Lysa with all my heart But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective He needs to learn how to swing a sword How to ride a horse
lord royce	Aye, its time
littlefinger	Yes, its time Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain Time for Robin to leave the nest

sansa	If theyd have executed you, what would they have done with me?
littlefinger	I dont know
sansa	Neither do I
littlefinger	Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you dont? And you think you know me?
sansa	I know what you want
littlefinger	Do you?
cut to	OUTSIDE THE VALE
sandor	I thought itd make me happy, but it doesnt Not really Nothing makes you happy
arya	Lots of things make me happy
sandor	Like what?
arya	Killing Polliver, killing Rorge
sandor	So youre sad because you didnt get to kill Joffrey yourself Is that it?
arya	At least I could have been there to watch I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over
sandor	Aye, nothing in the world beats that look
arya	You protected him for most of his life You think you could have saved him?
sandor	I wasnt the damn wine taster Little shit deserved to die, but poison poisons a womans weapon Men kill with steel
arya	Thats your stupid pride talking Its why youll never be a great killer Id have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to
sandor	  Id pay good money to see that  rubs his neck 
arya	You should have let me burn it
sandor	Its a fleabite
arya	That fleabites got you walking a lot slower than you used to
sandor	Well, we wont have to walk too much further
arya	You really think my aunt will pay for me?
sandor	Aye, shell pay
arya	Ive never even met her
sandor	Doesnt matter Youre her blood Family, honor, all that horseshit Its all you lords and ladies ever talk about
arya	Im not a lady
guard	Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

margaery	I’m very hungry
margaery	What’s your name?
olyvar	Olyvar, my lady
margaery	I’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar
margaery	Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
loras	Why? They all know about me anyway Everybody knows everything about everyone What’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
margaery	In any event you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting
loras	My intended? Please Tywin’s dead That means no one can force Cersei to marry me
margaery	Lucky you
loras	Unlucky you
margaery	You think I want that woman married to my brother?
loras	If she doesn’t marry me, she doesn’t go to Highgarden Which means she stays in King’s Landing Which means you’re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law
margaery	Perhaps
loras	Perhaps?
margaery	Perhaps?
tyrion	Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers
varys	Imp, half-man
varys	There are faster ways to kill yourself
tyrion	Not for a coward
varys	You are many things, my friend, but not a coward
tyrion	You never told me why you set me free
varys	Your brother asked me to
tyrion	You could have said no
varys	Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition
tyrion	Not as dangerous as releasing me You risked your life, your position, everything Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing
varys	I didn’t do it for you I did it for the Seven Kingdoms
tyrion	A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms
varys	I don’t believe in saviors I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come
tyrion	You’re going to have to find another soldier I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me
varys	You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power But earning it for yourself, that takes work
tyrion	I’m not well-suited for work
varys	I think you are You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion
tyrion	Compassion? Yes I killed my lover with my bare hands I shot my own father with a crossbow
varys	I never said you were perfect
tyrion	What is it you want exactly?
varys	Peace Prosperity A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless
tyrion	Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place
varys	Perhaps And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?
tyrion	I will never sit on the Iron Throne
varys	No, you won’t But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name
tyrion	Good luck finding him
varys	Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for
tyrion	Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
daario naharis	When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven’t been behaving themselves
hizdahr zo loraq	The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review
daenerys	Good
hizdahr	They did ask for some concessions
daenerys	Concessions?
hizdahr	Politics is the art of compromise, your grace
daenerys	I’m not a politician I’m a queen
hizdahr	Forgive me You’re right, of course Still, it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones
daenerys	I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery
hizdahr	They do not ask for the return of slavery They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits
daenerys	The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
hizdahr	In the new world that you’ve brought to us, free men would fight free men
hizdahr	The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity Bring some here and ask them yourself
daenerys	No fighting pits
hizdahr	Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions
daenerys	I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting
hizdahr	If you-
daenerys	How many times must I say no before you understand?
daenerys	Whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it If he really believes I’m going to reopen the fighting pits
daario	You should reopen the fighting pits
daenerys	What?
daario	My mother was a whore, I told you that She liked to drink pear brandy The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before
daenerys	Why?
daario	I was a bad child I wasn’t big, but I was quick And I loved to fight So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits I had my first match when I was 16
daenerys	You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?
daario	I’m only here because of those pits I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight Soon I was famous 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you
daario	You’re the queen Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth Everyone but me You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack Show your strength here, now
daenerys	That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets
daario	Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied You’re not the Mother of Unsullied You’re the Mother of Dragons
daenerys	I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet No one’s seen Drogon in weeks For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world I can’t control them anymore
daario	A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen
daenerys	Viserion? Rhaegal?
daenerys	Easy Easy Easy
mance	So here we are
jon	Here we are
mance	When we first met you were my prisoner And now, for our last meeting
jon	This doesn’t have to be our last meeting
mance	No, but it will be
jon	You know what Stannis wants?
mance	He wants me to bend the knee And he wants the free folk to fight for him I’ll give him this much he’s bold
jon	Shouldn’t a king be bold?
mance	Oh, aye I respect him If he gets what he wants, I expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years But I’ll never serve him
jon	You told me you weren’t here to conquer You told me your people have bled enough
mance	That’s right But I don’t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either
jon	You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants A life’s work uniting them You didn’t do it for power You didn’t do it for glory You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?
mance	Pride? Fuck my pride This isn’t about that
jon	Then bend the knee and save your people
mance	They followed me because they respected me Because they believed in me The moment I kneel for a Southern king that’s all gone
jon	And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid
mance	Oh, I am afraid No shame in that How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?
jon	They’ll burn you alive
mance	Bad way to go I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to die And burnt to death, I don’t want people to remember me like that Scorched and screaming But it’s better than betraying everything I believe
jon	And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you You’d rather burn than kneel The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing
mance	You’re a good lad Truly, you are But if you can’t understand why I won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war, there’s no point explaining
jon	I think you’re making a terrible mistake
mance	The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted
stannis	Mance Rayder, you’ve been called the King Beyond the Wall Westeros only has one king Bend the knee, I promise you mercy
stannis	Kneel and live
mance	This was my home for many years I wish you good fortune in the wars to come

braavosi man	In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes Hed wade into the sea and smash the enemies

arya	Im not afraid
man	The House of Black and White this is where youll find the man you seek

arya	Hello Valar Morghulis
arya	Jaqen H’ghar gave me this

podrick	Must be good food if it’s crowded
waitress	Ale? Ale?
sansa	Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll
littlefinger	You are becoming an observant young lady
sansa	My mother used to say, dark wings, dark words
littlefinger	An old saying Inaccurate in this case
sansa	So it was good news.?
littlefinger	My marriage proposal has been accepted
sansa	I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa
waitress	Ale?
sansa	Ill have some
podrick	My lady
brienne	What is it?
podrick	Sansa Stark Dont look
brienne	You sure?
podrick	Shes dyed her hair, but its her Shes sitting with Petyr Baelish
brienne	Littlefinger?
podrick	A bunch of knights with him BRIENNE Bunch? Whats a bunch? 100? 6? 20?
podrick	10, I think Too many My lady, I dont think this is the right-
brienne	Ready the horses
podrick	We only have one horse
brienne	Find more
littlefinger	Do you like the taste?
sansa	I dont see what all the fuss is about Why do men love it so much?
littlefinger	It gives some men courage
sansa	Does it give you courage?
guard	Thats far enough
brienne	Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth
littlefinger	Weve met With Renly Baratheon What did he say about you? He said, Youre a loyalty comes free of charge Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then
brienne	Lady Sansa, before your mothers death, I was her sworn sword I gave my word I would find you and protect you I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be I swear it by the old gods and the new
littlefinger	Please, Lady Brienne No need for such formality You are Catelyn Starks sworn sword?
brienne	I was
littlefinger	Strange I knew Cat from the time we were children She never mentioned you
brienne	It was after Renlys murder
littlefinger	Ah, yes You were accused of killing him
brienne	I tried to save him
littlefinger	But you were accused
brienne	By men who didnt see what happened
littlefinger	Then what did happen?
brienne	He was murdered by a shadow A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon
littlefinger	"A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly she failed She swore to protect your mother she failed Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?"
brienne	Why should you have any say in her affairs?
littlefinger	Because I am her uncle I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved’s untimely death Were family now, and youre an outsider Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders
brienne	Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone-
sansa	No
brienne	Please, my lady If I could explain-
sansa	I saw you at Joffreys wedding bowing to the king
brienne	Neither of us wanted to be there Sometimes we dont have a choice
sansa	And sometimes we do You should leave
littlefinger	We dont want our new friend wandering the countryside alone The roads of these parts arent safe Why dont you stay?
knight	He asked you to stay
guard	After her
brienne	Podrick
podrick	Stop, stop, stop! That’s a good boy
knight	I guess that means you’re unarmed
brienne	Down, Podrick, down
brienne	Podrick?
podrick	Yes, my lady?
brienne	You can stand now
podrick	Yes, my lady Sansa Stark?
brienne	Wary of strangers, as she should me I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger We’ll follow them
podrick	My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you’re released from your vow
brienne	I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls
podrick	If they don’t want your protection-
brienne	Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?
podrick	No, my lady
brienne	Get your horse
jaime	A summons from the queen
cersei	There are only two like it in the world the one I’m wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella
jaime	It’s a threat
cersei	Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family Its a threat
jaime	No note
cersei	They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her
jaime	Softer
cersei	What?
jaime	Not so loud
cersei	Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly
jaime	The world cant know knows she’s our daughter
cersei	Then don’t call her your daughter You’ve never been a father to her
jaime	If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets
cersei	And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden
jaime	I’ll make things better
cersei	You never made anything better
jaime	I’m going to Dorne I’ll bring our daughter home
cersei	You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son
jaime	I’m not going to ask him anything
cersei	You go there with an army, it’s an act of war
jaime	No army Do you know where they’re keeping her?
cersei	Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens
jaime	I’ll find her Is there anything else, your grace?
cersei	You’re going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
jaime	I never said I was going alone
lollys stokeworth	No sunflowers I dont like yellow Roses are very nice, definitely roses And music I adore music But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes Then theres the food Food is the most important thing, dont you agree? Were going to need pigeon pies Thats what they eat in the capital, dont they?
lollys	Dont they?
bronn	Dont who?
lollys	People eat pigeon pie in the capital
bronn	They certainly do, my dear They certainly do
bronn	Its a fine place, isnt it? A fine place I never thought Id end up settling down in a place like this
lollys	You wont
bronn	Pardon?
lollys	We wont get to live at Stokeworth When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because shes older
bronn	Oh
lollys	She hates me She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isnt looking
bronn	You know what I think? I think youre a good person And your sister is a mean person
lollys	She is
bronn	Ive been all over the world And if theres one thing Ive learned, its that meanness comes around People like your sister, they always get whats coming to them eventually One way or another
lollys	Whos that?
bronn	Jaime fucking Lannister
bronn	Ser Jaime
jaime	Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
bronn	I was very sorry to hear about your father
jaime	Thank you
bronn	This is my betrothed, Lollys

jaime	Beautiful bride youve chosen When were you planning on getting married?
bronn	Just get on with it
jaime	On with what?

jaime	Its very good for you
bronn	Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken
jaime	Mmm
bronn	We made a deal, your sister and I
jaime	I would have advised against that
bronn	How is this good for me?
jaime	Cause youre going to come with me and help me with something important And when we return, Im going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle
bronn	Return from where?
jaime	As far south as south goes
trystane	My future queen
areo	The prince does not wish to be disturbed
ellaria	Remove myself from my path, or Ill take that long axe and shove it-
doran	Captain Let her pass
ellaria	Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing
doran	Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat By law, that is not murder
ellaria	Your brother-
doran	You dont have to remind me He was my brother long before he was anything to you
ellaria	What will you do about his death
doran	I will bury him I will mourn for him
ellaria	You would have me go to war?
doran	You would have me go to war?
ellaria	The whole country would have you go to war
doran	Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide
ellaria	The Sand Snakes are with me They have the love of their people They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing
ellaria	Oberyn is dead And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill? Let me have her Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time
doran	I loved my brother And you made him very happy For that you will always have a place in my heart But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance Not here Not while I rule
ellaria	And how long will that be?
daario	The Unsullied are too conspicuous
daario	Anyone can see you coming from a mile off Of course you havent found any Sons of the Harpy You havent, have you?
daario	My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets they blend in They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things Before you know it.
grey worm	No one here We go
daario	In a hurry? Youre afraid?
grey worm	Unsullied fear nothing
daario	Right Thats your problem You understood fear once, long ago, but youve forgotten what it means Someone whos forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide
daario	Fear is useful that way
mossador	Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck On all of our necks Please, Your Grace, you must kill him
daenerys	It would send a message
barristan	I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace
daenerys	Why?
barristan	For one thing, he may have valuable information
daario	The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information
barristan	How do you know that?
daario	Because I questioned him
hizdahr	And the information you did get, he is young and poor
mossador	He is born free
hizdahr	Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
daenerys	Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was
mossador	They pay him Great families afraid to do a thing They pay poor man to do it for them
hizdahr	And how do you know this?
mossador	Everyone knows this
hizdahr	I dont know it, and Im the head of a great family
barristan	We do not know what this man did or didnt do Give him a trial, at least A fair trial Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose Teach them a better way
mossador	I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes Things maybe are different there, I hope But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us So we learn much about them or we do not live long They teach me what they are Mercy
fair trial	these mean nothing to them All they understand is blood
daenerys	Thank you all for your counsel
barristan	Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you
daenerys	About what?
barristan	About your father About the Mad King
daenerys	The Mad King? Youre here to remind me of my enemies lies? Consider me reminded
barristan	Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard I was at his side from the first Your enemies did not lie
daenerys	Go on
barristan	When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame He murdered sons in front of their fathers He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two
daenerys	Im not my father
barristan	No, Your Grace Thank the gods But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved And each time it made him feel powerful and right Until the very end
daenerys	I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial
barristan	Your Grace
tyrion	Theres a bug
varys	Yes, best be careful You might accidentally consume some solid food
tyrion	When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?
varys	You dont like it?
tyrion	I want to take a walk
varys	You cant Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head
tyrion	She ought to offer her cunt Best part of her for the best part of me Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere
varys	Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
tyrion	Youre right No point The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen Whats in Volantis?
varys	The road to Meereen
tyrion	And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
varys	I told you A ruler
tyrion	Weve already got a ruler Everywhere has already got a ruler Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someones banner hanging from it
varys	You were quite good, you know At ruling During your brief tenure as Hand
tyrion	I didnt rule I was a servant
varys	Still, a man of talent
tyrion	Managed to kill a lot of people
varys	Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well
tyrion	She wanted me to leave Kings Landing She begged me I wouldnt go
varys	Why?
tyrion	Cause I liked it Power Even as a servant
varys	People follow leaders And they will never follow us They find us repulsive
tyrion	I find us repulsive
varys	And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box Not for long
tyrion	Youre right Lets go for a walk
varys	No
tyrion	How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
cersei	Not him
meryn	Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?
cersei	That wont be necessary, I dont want to dissuade the other hunters Mistakes will be made
hunters	Thank you, Your Grace Thank you
cersei	Take the head
qyburn	Pardon me, Your Grace I would take it, if you dont mind It could prove useful for my work
cersei	Very good
qyburn	Over there will be fine
meryn	You heard the man Over there
kevan	Youre the Hand of the King?
cersei	No, Uncle Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role Im merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself
mace	Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the Kings Hand until he becomes old enough-
cersei	Youre a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I dont imagine youll have the time In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin
mace	Oh, Your Grace
cersei	He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled He said he would be honored to have you represent the crowns interests in the same
mace	The honor is all mine, Your Grace
pycelle	Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the Kings Hand
cersei	ing has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers
pycelle	Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?
cersei	The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester Thats far more than the eunuch ever had Far more than many ever have
pycelle	I must say I cannot see-
cersei	Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War No man living better deserves the title
kevan	That is kind of you to say I would like to hear it from the king himself
cersei	The king is very busy at this moment
kevan	He should be here, learning what it means to rule
cersei	He is learning On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, hes asked me to speak on his behalf
kevan	I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother And to you And to serve the king I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet To watch you stack the small council with sycophants Sending your own brother away so he wouldnt be-
cersei	My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission
kevan	What mission?
cersei	That is not your concern as Master of War
kevan	I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern You are the Queen Mother Nothing more
cersei	You would abandon your king in his time of need?
kevan	If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him At Casterly Rock
shireen	Come on You know this one It looks like an animal
gilly	Snake Snake S! Its an S
shireen	Right, very good
sam	Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?
gilly	I know S
shireen	Youll learn, I promise I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things
gilly	Well, youre a wonderful teacher Very patient
sam	I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster youll be able to read
gilly	Thats alright Were doing just fine Im sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about
gilly	How old were you when you learned to read?
shireen	Three
sam	Three?! Who taught you, your mother?
shireen	No Old Maester Cressen did I had a lot of time to practice My mother kept me inside because.
gilly	What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?
shireen	Greyscale What do you call it north of the Wall?
gilly	I dont know But two of my sisters had it They both died How did they cure you?
shireen	I dont remember I was a baby Lots of people came and tried, I think Whatever they did, it went away What happened to your sisters?
gilly	My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside None of us were allowed to go near them But we heard them Especially at night They started to sound not like themselves
sam	Did you ever see them?
gilly	Only once at the end They were covered with it Their faces, their arms They acted like animals My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope
shireen	What did he do to them in the woods?
shireen	Mother
selyse	Leave us
sam	Your Grace
selyse	You need to stay away from that girl
shireen	Why?
selyse	Shes a wildling
shireen	Her names Gilly Shes nice Im teaching her to read
selyse	Shes a wildling Your father defeated their people He executed her king for treason They could strike at him by striking at you
shireen	Gilly wouldnt do that
selyse	You have no idea what people will do All your books and you still dont know
stannis	I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake You prevented that order from being carried out You showed mercy to Mance Rayder A kings word is law Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers Show too much kindness, people wont fear you If people dont fear you, they dont follow you
jon	With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do Youre the man who burned their king alive
stannis	Who then? You?
jon	No Only one of their own
stannis	Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
jon	The Lord Commanders niece
stannis	Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10 I asked her to commit her house to my cause, thats her response
jon	Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark
stannis	That amuses you?
jon	I apologize, Your Grace Northerners can be a bit like the free folk Loyal to their own
stannis	I know My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them even with your fathers help
davos	Tonight, the Nights Watch elect a new Lord Commander Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win
jon	Most likely
davos	Unpleasant man He thinks youre a traitor Whats your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
jon	Unpleasant, I expect
stannis	Your bravery made him look weak Hell punish you for it I dont punish men for bravery I reward them
jon	I dont doubt it, Your Grace But Im a brother of the Nights Watch Ive pledged them my life, my honor, my sword I dont know what I have left to give you
stannis	You can give me the North
jon	I cant Even if I wanted to, Im a bastard A Snow
stannis	Kneel before me Lay your sword at my feet Pledge me your service and youll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell
sam	Hell make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
jon	Its the first thing I ever remember wanting Id daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again
sam	You deserve this You do I couldnt be happier for you
jon	Im going to refuse him
sam	But youd be Lord of Winterfell
jon	I swore a vow to the Nights Watch If I dont take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?
alliser	Crowded Youd think we were serving venison stew
aemon	Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch?
janos	Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, hes a man of true nobility He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings
men	Hear, hear
janos	Hes a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life Hes the only true choice
aemon	Is there anyone else?
shadow tower brother	Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger Through 10 winters he served As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away We could do no better
aemon	If theres no one else, we will begin the voting The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister Each brother will-
sam	Maester Aemon
aemon	Samwell Tarly Go on
janos	Sam the Slayer
janos	Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow Hows your lady love Slayer?
sam	Her name is Gilly Brother Slynt knows her quite well They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall
janos	Lies
sam	A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making
sam	Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading
sam	Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us He took charge of the walls defense He killed the Magnar of the Thenns He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward He saw something in Jon, and now weve all seen it, too He may be young, but hes the commander we turned to when the night was darkest
alliser	I cant argue with any of that But who does Jon Snow want to command? Nights Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stanniss army hadnt come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?
aemon	It is time
brother	It appears to be a tie, Maester
brothers	Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow
man	You You
man	What have you got there?
man	I said-
arya	Turn around and go Turn around and go
man	Thats a nice little sword Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that
arya	Nothings worth anything to dead men
men	Quickly, go, go
arya	Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
old man	You lost this
arya	You said there was no Jaqen Hghar here
jaqen	There isnt A man is not Jaqen Hghar
arya	Well who are you then?
jaqen	No one And that is who a girl must become
harpy	She doesnt belong here And no matter how many of your traitors call her Mhysa , she will never be your mother
daenerys	Why?
mossador	For you, Mhysa You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied I set you free, as you did all of us
daenerys	He was our prisoner, awaiting trial You had no right
mossador	He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt
daenerys	There are no more slaves There are no more Masters
mossador	Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you I remember the look on my fathers face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog My father died in the fighting If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived
daenerys	The Harpys life was not yours to take Once, the Masters were the law-
mosador	and now you are the law
daenerys	The law is the law Take him
crowd	Mhysa! Myhsa
hizdahr	She should have cut off the traitors head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it
daario	Which is what I keep telling her to do to you
daenerys	You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice One cannot exist without the other
crowd	Brother! Brother
mossador	Mhysa, please! Forgive me
daenerys	A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him The punishment is death
crowd	Mercy! Mercy
mossador	Mhysa.
crowd	Mhysa.
barristan	Ill stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace
grey worm	We all guard tonight
daenerys	Leave me

jaqen	Valar dohaeris
arya	Ive been sweeping this floor for days
jaqen	Good
arya	I didnt come here to sweep floors
jaqen	No? Why come, then?
arya	You said that I could be your apprentice You said youd teach me how to a Faceless Man
jaqen	A man teaches a girl Valar dohaeris All men must serve Faceless men, most of all
arya	I want to serve
jaqen	A girl wants to serve herself Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well A girl must become no-one
arya	Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger I see the Drowned God I see the Weirwood Face
jaqen	There is only one god A girl knows his name And all men know his gift
arya	Where are they taking him?
bystanders	Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! MARGAERY
tommen	I am his/hers, and she/he is mine From this day, until the end of my days
tommen	Did I hurt you?
margaery	No You were lovely
tommen	It all happened so fast
margaery	Yes
tommen	I was scared maybe I hurt you
it sounded margaery	No, no, no Youre very sweet The sweetest king who ever lived
tommen	This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life
margaery	Wouldnt that be glorious? Shouldnt we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, theres no rush, is there?
tommen	Of course not Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
margaery	No, Im fine I just want you all to myself I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name
tommen	King Tommen It still sounds strange to me Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
margaery	So strange Husband
tommen	Wife Sometimes it feels odd Im the king, Ive married the most beautiful woman in the world, , and its all because my brother died
margaery	I understand But its not your fault, you know that, dont you? You mustnt feel guilty
tommen	I dont feel guilty Thats whats odd
tommen	Do you like to sail?
margaery	I love to sail
tommen	I do, too
margaery	I think were going to be very happy, you and I
tommen	I do, too
margaery	Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds Of course my grandmother couldnt wait to go home The capital is not for everyone, I suppose Does your mother like it here?
tommen	I dont think so She told me never to trust anyone in Kings Landing
margaery	Its so wonderful to have her watching over you A lioness guiding her cub
tommen	Well, but Im a man now
margaery	You are And the king But youll always be her baby-boy
tommen	I suppose
margaery	I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind And the horror shes had to injure Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father Its no wonder shes so protective of you Shell never let you out of her sight
cersei	You look very much in love The first days of marriage are often so blissful Shes certainly very pretty, isnt she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot Do you think shes intelligent? I cant quite tell Not that it matters
tommen	Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
cersei	Theres nothing for me in Casterly Rock
tommen	Thats where you grew up You always told me that you liked the people there better You said that Kings Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk
cersei	Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
tommen	The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it That you That it was your real home
cersei	This is my real home now Where my family lives
tommen	I want you to be happy, mother
cersei	I know that I know you do, my sweet boy
tommen	But wouldnt you be happier in Casterly Rock?
margaery	I said, Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record? And he said, Well, what is the record? Im sure we can break it
margaery	Mother! Welcome
cersei	Dont you look lovely Marriage agrees with you
margaery	Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you Its a bit early in the day for us
cersei	No, no I, I cant stay I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you
margaery	You are very sweet
cersei	Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen
margaery	I absolutely adore him You raised a gallant young man Im forever grateful
cersei	Good Good Im glad to hear youre happy
margaery	Ecstatic I really am Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag
cersei	Ill leave you to it then
margaery	Oh, forgive me, I havent been at Court for long, I get so confused Whats the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?
cersei	Theres no need for such formalities
margaery	In any event, judging from the Kings enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon
cersei	Won’t that be a lovely day
margaery	Can you imagine the celebrations? Theyll ring the bells all day and night
cersei	Remember Anything you need
roose	We cant hold the North with terror alone
ramsay	You cant hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us
roose	I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies
ramsay	Lord Cerwyn refused to pay Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and hed be damned if he kissed a traitors boot
roose	He left you no choice
ramsay	I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother Made his son watch
roose	And?
ramsay	The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes
roose	I have something important to tell you Stop eating and listen
roose	We dont have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us Do you understand that?
ramsay	Our pact with the Lannisters protects
roose	I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact Theyve never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north If you think they will for us, youre a fool We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power The best way to forge a lasting alliance isnt by peeling a mans skin off The best way is marriage Now that youre a Bolton by royal decree, its time you married a suitable bride And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North
sansa	Thats Moat Cailin
littlefinger	Yes A bit shabby, isnt it? Youve been here before
sansa	On our way down to Kings Landing, with my father and Arya and where are you taking me?
littlefinger	Home
sansa	The Boltons have Winterfell The marriage proposal, it wasnt for you?
littlefinger	No
sansa	Roose Bolton murdered my brother He betrayed my family
sansa	He serves the Lannisters
littlefinger	For now
sansa	I wont go
littlefinger	Winterfell is your home
sansa	Not anymore
littlefinger	Always Youre a Stark Dyeing your hair doesnt change that Youre Sansa Stark The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark Your place is in the North
sansa	I cant marry him You cant make me Hes a traitor A murderer
littlefinger	Youre not marrying Roose Bolton No, youll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay One day hell be Warden of the North and you will
sansa	No
littlefinger	Sansa
sansa	No, you cant make me I will starve myself I will die before I have to go there
littlefinger	I wont force you to do anything Dont you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me Listen Youve been running all your life Terrible things happened to your family and you weep You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates Youve been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running Theres no justice in the world Not unless we make it You loved your family Avenge them
podrick	How do we get through there?
brienne	We dont We go around
podrick	It sets miles out of the way Well lose sight of them
brienne	Doesnt matter I know where theyre going
brienne	Arent you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
podrick	He hates that nickname
brienne	Well, hes not here to complain about it, is he?
podrick	I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings One night, he had a bit too much to drink And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham
brienne	He borrowed it?
podrick	He wasnt a thief He was drunk and hungry and he wasnt thinking I was drunk too He gave me half the ham Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand They hanged the man afternoon They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne So he pardoned me, and sent me to Kings Landing to squire for his son
brienne	As punishment For both of you
podrick	It didnt seem that way Lord Tyrion was always very good to me
brienne	Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you All except me Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person
podrick	Im not sorry Youre the best fighter Ive ever seen You beat The Hound Im proud to be your squire
brienne	Im sorry Im always snapping at you
podrick	If you wouldnt snap at me I wouldnt learn anything
brienne	You want to be a knight, Pod?
podrick	Yes
brienne	Starting tomorrow, well train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening And Im going to show you how to ride properly
podrick	Thank you
brienne	I cant knight you, but I can teach you how to fight
podrick	I suppose thats more important
podrick	You werent a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, werent you?
brienne	I was
podrick	Lord Tyrion said he was a good man
brienne	He was
podrick	But how did you end up serving Renly?
brienne	When I was a girl, my father held a ball Im his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth I didnt want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom And it was wonderful None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles My father smiled at me and I smiled at him Id never been so happy Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering And then they all started to laugh, they couldnt keep the game going any longer They were toying with me Brienne the Beauty’, they called me Great joke And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive A great lumbering beast I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms Dont let them see your tears,” he told me They’re nasty little shits The nasty little shits arent worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word And he was the kings brother after all
podrick	But wasnt he Lord Tyrion said he was.
brienne	Yes, Pod, he liked men, Im not an idiot He didnt love me, he didnt want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldnt see me hurt He saved me from being a joke From that day until his last day And I couldnt save him in return Nothings more hateful than failing to protect the one you love One day, I will avenge King Renly
podrick	But you said a shadow murdered him How do you fight a shadow?
brienne	A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon I know it was Stannis I know it in my heart Stannis is a man, not a shadow And a man can be killed
stannis	Lord Commander
jon	Your Grace
stannis	Id like to speak alone
jon	Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormonts I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience One day, he might command
stannis	Very well Have you considered my offer?
jon	I have And I thank you for it You do me great honor All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark
stannis	Say the word and you will be
jon	But I have to refuse you Im Lord Commander of the Nights Watch My place is here
stannis	Im giving you a chance to avenge your family To take back the castle where you grew up To rule the North
jon	I wish I could fight beside you Believe me, I do But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood I pledged my life to the Nights Watch
stannis	Youre as stubborn as your father And as honorable
jon	I can imagine no higher praise
stannis	I didnt mean it as praise Honor got your father killed But if your mind’s made up, I wont try to persuade you
jon	May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?
stannis	Are you bored of us already?
jon	You saved us from Mance Rayders army We will never forget that But its a question of survival The Nights Watch cant continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely Winter is coming
stannis	I know it We march on Winterfell within the fortnight Before the snows trap us here
jon	And the wildlings?
stannis	Theyd rather burn than fight for me, so be it I leave their fate to you You could execute them, thats the safest course Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was I assume the brothers of the Nights Watch would rather see the wildlings dead
jon	Most of the brothers, yes Theres little love for the free folk here
stannis	Youre the Lord Commander Your decision
stannis	You have many enemies in Castle Black Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
jon	I heard it was best to keep your enemies close
stannis	Whoever said that didnt have many enemies
davos	He sees something in you Might not be apparent from his tone, but its the truth He believes in you
jon	Im sorry I disappointed him
davos	The king is a complicated man But he wants whats right for the Seven Kingdoms
jon	As long as hes ruling them
davos	Hes the one true king He has the blood right to that throne
jon	I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms
davos	Have you now? How does the Nights Watch vow go again? I bet youve got it memorized since you got here
olly	Night gathers and now my watch begins
davos	Not that bit, the bit at the end
olly	Im the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men I pledge my life
davos	Wait, thats enough The shield that guards the realm of men.” Thats what you swore to be Now Im not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing
jon	And what needs to be done?
davos	As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer Just one mans opinion
arya	What do you want?
waif	Who are you?
arya	What?
waif	You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect Who are you?
arya	No one
arya	Ow! Cunt
waif	A lie, a sad little lie Who are you?
arya	I told you, Im no Do that again and
waif	Who are you?
arya	Youre about to find out
jaqen	What are you doing?
waif	We were only playing The game of faces
jaqen	A girl is not ready
waif	Clearly not
arya	I am ready
jaqen	For what? For whatever you want To be a Faceless Man To be no one
jaqen	Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark Arya Starks sword, Arya Starks clothes, Arya Starks stolen silver A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Starks things?
arya	What do we do with them after we wash them?
man	Open gates
roose	Lady Sansa, welcome
sansa	Lord Bolton
roose	May I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?
ramsay	Its an honor to meet you, my Lady
woman	Ill bring you a bowl of hot water You must want to wash
sansa	Thank you
woman	Welcome home, Lady Stark The North remembers
jon	Sam Maester Aemon?
sam	He apologizes for not being here Hes not feeling well
jon	Take good care of him Brothers As you all know too well, its long past time to dig a new latrine pit First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task Brian Seems like a good job for a ginger
jon	Ser Alliser You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack I name you First Ranger
jon	Lord Janos Im giving you command of Greyguard
janos	Greyguard is a ruin
jon	Yes, the fort is in a sorry state Restore it as best you can First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his
janos	I was charged with the defense of Kings Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes Keep your ruin
sam	Alright, alright! Enough of that
jon	You mistake me, my Lord That was a command, not an offer Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard
janos	I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you I will not have it Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it
jon	Are you refusing to obey my order?
janos	You can stick your order up your bastard arse
jon	Take Lord Janos outside
jon	Olly, bring me my sword
janos	You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, hes mistaken, yes, very mistaken
janos	A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! Youll see
jon	If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time
janos	I was wrong Youre the Lord Commander! We all serve you Im sorry Not only for this, for all Ive done and said I was wrong! My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! Ill go! I will! Please Im afraid Ive always been afraid
olyvar	You have served us well, my son
high septon	Thank you, Father
olyvar	Which of the Seven will you worship today?
high septon	The Maiden
olyvar	Where is the Maiden?
high septon	And the Stranger
olyvar	Two is extra, you realize?
high septon	Yes, yes
olyvar	What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish You cant
lancel	You have profaned our faith The faith of our fathers and forefathers
high septon	I am the High Septon of the
lancel	You are a sinner And you shall be punished
crowd	Sinner! Sinner! Sinner
man	Repent
crowd	Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner
man	Shame on you
crowd	Sinner! Sinner
high septon	Your Grace, , Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, , uh
qyburn	It doesnt matter
high septon	As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world An insult to me is an insult to the Gods An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion
cersei	You were assaulted?
high septon	I was, by those fanatics who call themselves sparrows’ They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones I am lucky to be alive
qyburn	I heard this all began in Littlefingers brothel
mace	High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear
high septon	I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother
qyburn	So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
pycelle	A mans private affairs ought to stay private
cersei	What do you want from us, High Septon?
high septon	Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow Hes a threat to everything we hold sacred If he goes unpunished
cersei	And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
meryn	I dont think this is a good idea, Your Grace
cersei	Nonsense, These are deeply religious people Where can I find the High Sparrow?
man	Seven blessings
man	Thank you
man	Just a little more.
woman	Thank you ever so for the soup
cersei	A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here Where is he?
high sparrow	High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesnt it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle So, its meant to Were often stuck with the names our enemies give to us The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesnt sit well with some, so they belittle me
woman	Seven blessings to you
high sparrow	Seven blessings to you, my dear Its only a name, quite an easy burden to wear Far easier than hers
cersei	Why no shoes?
high sparrow	Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more We all do that It stops us from forgetting what we really are
cersei	Is that why you came to Kings Landing? To remind everyone?
high sparrow	Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself Oh, I tell them no ones special And they think Im special for telling them so
cersei	Perhaps theyre right
high sparrow	It would be comforting to believe that, wouldnt it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not I had assumed youd only come here to arrest me For that incident with the High Septon
cersei	An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldnt you say?
high sparrow	Hypocrisy is a boil Lancing a is never pleasant Although, they could have been more careful with the blade
cersei	The High Septon came to speak to me today He doesnt want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you
high sparrow	I wouldnt presume to know your thoughts on the matter
cersei	My thoughts on the matter align with your own The High Septons behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside So now he resides in the Red Keeps dungeons instead The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world If one collapses, so does the other We must do everything necessary to protect one another
qyburn	Your Grace
cersei	Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever hes slithering about
qyburn	At once, Your Grace
cersei	Hows your work coming along?
qyburn	Very well
cersei	Youve made progress?
qyburn	More than Ive expected Still a way to go, but
cersei	Very good Ill leave you to it then Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word immediately
qyburn	Shh Easy, friend
ramsay	She really is lovely I hope I can make her happy
littlefinger	I hope so too Ive become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together She’s suffered enough
ramsay	Ill never hurt her You have my word
littlefinger	Ive heard very little about you Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go
ramsay	I havent been a lord very long I was a bastard
roose	And youre not anymore Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish
ramsay	Yes, father And thank you, Lord Baelish Im forever in your debt
littlefinger	He seems pleased
roose	Shouldnt he be?
littlefinger	I assure you shes still a virgin Tyrion never consummated the marriage By the law of the land, shes no mans wife Inspect her, if you must
roose	I leave that to the brothel keeper Its her name I need, not her virtue
littlefinger	Then I have delivered everything Ive promised
roose	And you prepared for the consequences When the Lannisters hear Ive wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay
littlefinger	The Lannister name doesnt mean what it once did Tywin is dead He kept his house in power through sheer will Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear
roose	The Queen will be enraged
littlefinger	Queen Margaery adores Sansa Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day
roose	And yet she still has friends Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours A message for you, from Cersei Lannister A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn Apparently, she thinks youre still in the Vale
littlefinger	A message for me, you say Strange that the seal is broken
roose	Im sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them Why gamble with your position?
littlefinger	Every ambitious move is a gamble You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Starks heart It appears that your gamble paid off Youre Warden of the North
roose	I had Tywin Lannister backing Who supports me now? You?
littlefinger	The Eyrie is mine The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known Id like to borrow one of your birds Cersei will expect a reply
roose	Id like to read the reply
tyrion	I have to get out of this wheelhouse
varys	Volantis is a large city
tyrion	I have to get out of this wheelhouse
varys	The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold
tyrion	Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse
varys	Im not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this
tyrion	I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind I cant remember the last face I saw that wasnt yours
varys	Its a perfectly good face
tyrion	Im losing my mind
varys	If anyone recognizes you, youll lose more than that
tyrion	Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros What am I? One more drunk dwarf
tyrion	Slaves
varys	Yes The Volantene masters are very organized Flies for dung shovelers Hammers for builders Tears for whores Lest they forget
priestess	Lord cast your light upon us
crowd	Lord cast your light upon us
priestess	For the night is dark and full of terrors
varys	We should keep moving
crowd	For the night is dark and full of terrors
priestess	I was once as you are now
priestess	Bought and sold, , scourged and branded.
tyrion	The only red priest we had in Kings Landing was Thoros of Myr This ones much better looking
priestess	"The Lord of Light hears your voice He hears the king as he hears the slave he hears the Stone Men in their misery."
tyrion	Stone men Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer Youd have better luck dancing away the plague
priestess	He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen
tyrion	Were going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me Who doesnt want to meet the Saviour?
tyrion	Come on Lets find a brothel
man	It’s good luck to rub a dwarf’s head
tyrion	Its even better luck to suck a dwarfs cock
tyrion	See? We blend right in Just two more travellers, mad with lust
varys	Thank you
tyrion	Curious hair
man	The mother of dragons
tyrion	It appears youre not the only Targaryen supporter
varys	Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously
man	What makes you worth that much?
blonde prostitute	I’m magic
man	I bet you bloody are
tyrion	Well, , shes taken
varys	Wherere you going?
tyrion	I need to speak to someone with hair
tyrion	Hello?
black haired prostitute	Hello
tyrion	Youve got no drink
black haired prostitute	Youve got no money
tyrion	Do I look like a man without money? Never trust looks Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? I always pay my debts, Im well known for it
black haired prostitute	You like her? They all like her They all want to fuck a queen
tyrion	That’s because they’ve never met a queen
black haired prostitute	Youre just saying that
tyrion	You know how to spot a liar If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you
black haired prostitute	Why?
tyrion	Because you have a skeptical mind
black haired prostitute	Alright, then Im warning you We’re gonna have to wash you first
black haired prostitute	Come on
tyrion	Im, Im sorry, I cant
black haired prostitute	Of course you can Youre shy
tyrion	Im not
black haired prostitute	Have another drink
tyrion	Gladly, but this, I cant do Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am I hope it passes What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start
tyrion	No need to worry, I was just Oh, I thought you were someone else Shows almost over Im sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige
tyrion	You made some kind of mistake Why dont you tell me what you think you are doing and
jaime	Is that Estermont?
captain	Tarth, Ser Jaime The Sapphire Isle
bronn	Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
jaime	This ships sailing to Oldtown Well get off earlier, not far from Sunspear Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night
bronn	You ever been to Dorne?
jaime	No
bronn	I have The Dornish are crazy All they want to do is fight and fuck Fuck and fight
jaime	You should be happy to go back
bronn	Theres nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking And theres nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight Its how the two work together And were gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure Well, I am But I dont imagine well get to stick around for the rest Not after weve kidnapped their princess
jaime	We are not kidnapping their princess We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family
bronn	Your niece?
bronn	Ive been doing this sort of thing a long time Im good at it
jaime	Thats why youre here
bronn	I know Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one
jaime	Because I dont want to start a war
bronn	That still doesnt explain why youre doing it
jaime	It has to be me
bronn	If Im putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, , who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not
jaime	It has to be me
bronn	You set your brother free, didnt you? I bet your sister didnt like that
jaime	Varys set him free
bronn	Well, if you ever see the little fucker, , give him my regards
jaime	He murdered my father If I ever see him, Ill split him in two And then Ill give him your regards
mace	The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crowns debts Given the expense of rebuilding the royal
cersei	How much can the Crown afford?
mace	With winter coming, half what they ask Less
cersei	Youre the Master of Coin How do we pay them?
mace	Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or Ill have words with my daughter
cersei	Youve already given us too much No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank
mace	Absolutely
cersei	In person
mace	Me?
cersei	We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect As the Kings Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified
mace	I will be honored, Your Grace
cersei	ing has expressed concern about his father-in-laws safety on this voyage Hes ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort
mace	My very own Kingsguard? Please express
cersei	Safe travels, Lord Tyrell
mace	Of course, of course, Ill give your regards to the Titan of Braavos
pycelle	The Small Council grows smaller and smaller
cersei	Not small enough
cersei	May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?
high sparrow	No
cersei	The old High Septon would have asked the vintage
high sparrow	I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure But the truth is, , I dont like the taste
cersei	Hmm
high sparrow	How may I serve?
cersei	All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned Silent sisters raped Bodies of holy men piled in the streets
high sparrow	Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods
cersei	Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven
high sparrow	Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago
cersei	If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy
high sparrow	An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people
cersei	An army and service to the Gods themselves And to you, of course As the chosen representative of the Seven
high sparrow	An honor I never expected Or indeed, ever wished for
cersei	Which is why you were chosen You and I both know how the world works Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most
high sparrow	All sinners are equal before the Gods
cersei	What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege
high sparrow	May the Father judge him justly
merchant	Help me! Help me
olyvar	This is Lord Petyr Baelishs establishment
militant	Cocksucker! Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! Theres a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind
client	Please, please, Ill pay! Ill pay all of you
militant	Yes, you will! Seize him
militant	Seize him
loras	Get your hands off of me
lancel	Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men
loras	Who do you think you are?
lancel	Justice
margaery	Why is my brother in a cell?
tommen	I, I dont know I, I didnt order it
margaery	We both know who did You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock
tommen	Are you saying my mother is behind this?
margaery	Shes jealous youre not hers anymore Arresting my brother is her revenge
tommen	Arent you and mother getting along?
margaery	Oh, my sweet, sweet King Do you have any affection for me at all?
tommen	Of course I do Youre my Queen
margaery	I cant bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell
tommen	Ill set him free for you
margaery	Do you promise?
tommen	I demand that Ser Loras be freed now
cersei	Did I arrest him?
tommen	Well, no But you armed the Faith Militant You gave the High Sparrow an army
cersei	I did And your wife has every right to criticize Cant allow fanatics to arrest the Queens brother, no matter his perversions
tommen	Then can I tell Margaery youll have Ser Loras released?
cersei	I told you I am not holding Ser Loras Youre the King Im sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, hell release the poor boy
kingsguard	Halt
militant	His Holiness is praying He will not be disturbed
kingsguard	Give the order and well tear out this rebel
tommen	You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?
kingsguard	Youll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love
man	Bastard
man	Youre an abomination
man	Youre born of sin
woman	Filthy bastard
tommen	Well find another way
man	Abomination
tommen	My Queen?
tommen	There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence
margaery	Youre the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law
tommen	Im going to speak to the High Sparrow
margaery	Are you? When?
tommen	I I dont know
margaery	You dont know?
tommen	He was praying just now
margaery	I have to send word to Grandmother
tommen	Will you come back later?
margaery	I need to be with my family, Your Grace
tommen	Of course
selyse	You think highly of this boy
jon	Good
stannis	Lord Commander of the Nights Watch
selyse	A bastard by some tavern slut
stannis	Perhaps, but that wasnt Ned Starks way
selyse	I should have given you a son
stannis	Not your fault
selyse	Whose then? I gave you nothing but weakness And deformity
melisandre	Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light
selyse	My Lady
melisandre	Her father is the Lords chosen King And her fathers blood runs through her veins
melisandre	You march on Winterfell soon?
stannis	We must To beat the snows
melisandre	Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind I hope you wont make that mistake again
stannis	I wont I need you
melisandre	You only need faith, my King
stannis	And you, my Lady, what do you need?
melisandre	To serve my Lord
sam	Lord Ashford Lady Caulfield Lord Smallwood
jon	Never even heard of these people
sam	They havent heard of you either But we need men and they have some
jon	And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
sam	More than Lord Wibberley
jon	Not him
sam	I know, Im sorry, but we need men and supplies And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North
jon	He murdered my brother
sam	We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall We cant watch the Wall with 50 men And we cant get more men without help from the Warden of the North
sam	Apologies, my Lady
melisandre	Lord Commander
jon	How can I help you?
melisandre	Come with us when we ride south None of us know the castle as well as you do Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people Winterfell was your home once Dont you want to chase the rats out of it?
jon	Castle Black is my home now Nights Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms
melisandre	Theres only one war Life against death Come Let me show what youre fighting for
jon	Youre gonna show me some vision in the fire Forgive me, my Lady But I dont trust in visions
melisandre	No visions No magic Just life
melisandre	Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and thats your mistake Embrace it
melisandre	The Lord of Light made us male and female Two parts of a greater whole We are joining this power Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows
jon	I dont think Stannis would like that very much
melisandre	Then we shouldnt tell him
jon	I cant
melisandre	Why?
jon	I swore a vow I loved another
melisandre	The dead dont need lovers Only the living
jon	I know But I still love her
melisandre	You know nothing, Jon Snow
stannis	Are you lonely?
shireen	Just bored
stannis	My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources
shireen	Were you bored a lot, too?
stannis	I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I
shireen	I like it I thought Id be left at home I know mother didnt want to bring me
stannis	Why do you say that?
shireen	She told me, I dont want to bring you
stannis	She shouldnt have said that
shireen	Are you ashamed of me, father?
stannis	When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone His goods were junk except for one wooden doll Hed even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House No doubt hed heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late I was told you would die Or worse, the grayscale would go slow Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle I told them all to go to hell I called in every maester on this side of the world Every healer, every apothecary They stopped the disease and saved your life Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon And you are my daughter
littlefinger	I thought I might find you here Your Aunt Lyanna
sansa	Father never talked about her Sometimes Id find him down here, lighting the candles They say she was beautiful
littlefinger	I saw her once I was a boy, living with your mothers family Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal Everyone was there The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair How handsome he was Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died Ive never seen so many people so quiet He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyannas lap Blue as frost How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?
sansa	Yes, he chose her and then he kidnapped her and raped her
littlefinger	Come Lets speak somewhere the dead cant hear us
sansa	Dressed for riding?
littlefinger	I am
sansa	Where are you going?
littlefinger	Kings Landing
sansa	Kings Landing?
littlefinger	Cersei sent for me We must not let her sniff out any trouble
sansa	You cant leave me here
littlefinger	I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me But it wont be for long
sansa	How do you know?
littlefinger	Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black Hell march south to Kings Landing before the winter snows block his way But first, he has to take Winterfell
sansa	You dont know that
littlefinger	I do Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons hell rally your fathers bannermen to his cause With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne
sansa	You think hell defeat the Boltons?
littlefinger	He has a larger army Hes the finest military commander in Westeros A betting man would put his money on Stannis As it happens, I am a betting man
sansa	And if youre right?
littlefinger	Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North Grateful for your late fathers courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North
sansa	But I, I wouldnt Wardeness of the North
littlefinger	You are the last surviving Stark He needs you
sansa	What if youre wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?
littlefinger	Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours
sansa	I dont know how to do that
littlefinger	Of course you do Hes already fallen for you
sansa	His father frightens me
littlefinger	He should, hes a dangerous man But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered And you’ve learnt to maneuver from the very best I return before too long Youll be strong without me The North will be yours Do you believe me?
sansa	I expect Ill be a married woman by the time you return
bronn	Breakfast
bronn	That would have been a shit way to die
jaime	As far as Ive seen, theyre all shit ways to die
bronn	Aye But your lot like to give the singers a good ending
jaime	I dont care whats sung about me when Im dead
bronn	No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess Sounds like a good song to me
jaime	Sounds like all the rest
jaime	What about you? What shit way would you choose?
bronn	In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune
jaime	How disappointing I thought youd have something more exciting planned
bronn	Ive had an exciting life I want my death to be boring How do you want to go?
jaime	In the arms of the woman I love
bronn	She want the same thing?
jaime	Lets go
bronn	The captain to that ship What was he, Braavosi?
jaime	Pentoshi
bronn	And hes headed to Oldtown?
jaime	As I said Why?
bronn	Whats to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannisters in Dorne?
jaime	A bag of gold
bronn	Im not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world
jaime	It was a heavy bag
bronn	And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it But you wont be around if he breaks them
bronn	How many you count?
jaime	Four
bronn	How many you think you can take?
jaime	One, if hes slow
rider	Halt
bronn	Fucked in the arse Hiya! Morning, lads Glad we found you
rider	Who are you?
bronn	Cooper This is Darnell
rider	Youre from Kings Landing
bronn	Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom Whelped and whipped
rider	Why are you here?
bronn	Our ship capsized in the night We managed to swim ashore It was a near thing, really
jaime	I thought the sharks would get us
rider	There are no sharks in Dorne
jaime	I could have sworn those were shark fins
bronn	Dolphins maybe
rider	Throw your swords in the sand
bronn	Boys, theres no need for this Just, point us in the right direction Well find our way home
rider	Swords in the sand! Now
bronn	That one should be slow enough
bronn	Nice move!
jaime	Luck
bronn	You had a wonderful teacher
bronn	Always wanted a Dornish stallion Beasts can run a day and night without tiring Well ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face
jaime	First we need to bury these bodies
bronn	Birds have to eat too
jaime	Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies Were not here to start a war
bronn	Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
jaime	I cant dig very well with one hand Not at all, really
tyene	Nama
elaria	Nym, Obara
obara	Will it be war?
elaria	Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else We must avenge Oberyn ourselves
obara	Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters
elaria	We dont need an army to start a war Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them
nymeria	We may have a problem
obara	A ships captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne
elaria	Hes come for Myrcella If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge You must choose Dorans way and peace, or my way and war
tyene	Im with you Always
elaria	Nym? Obara?
obara	When I was a child, , Oberyn came to take me to court Id never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said, Girl or boy, we fight our battles But the Gods let us choose our weapons My father pointed to the spear, and then to my mothers tears
obara	I made my choice long ago
tyrion	Thank you Who are you?
jorah	Your captor
tyrion	Do you have wine?
jorah	No
tyrion	I cant sleep without wine
jorah	Then stay awake
tyrion	Youre going the wrong way My sisters in Westeros Westeros is west! Were heading east
jorah	Im not taking you to your sister
tyrion	You said you were taking me to the Queen
jorah	I am Queen Daenerys Targaryen Shes the Queen I serve
tyrion	What a waste of a good kidnapping So happens I was heading there myself
jorah	What business would you have with the Queen?
tyrion	Gold and glory Oh, and hate If youve ever met my sister, youd understand So now that its clear were on the same side? A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate Youre Jorah Mormont I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, werent you? Its all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but its all coming back You passed notes to Varyss little birds She found out, didnt she? Found out, and exiled you And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift A risky scheme One might even say, desperate Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? Id say the reverse is just as likely
daenerys	Everyone looks happy enough from up here What?
barristan	I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of Kings Landing
daenerys	Why?
barristan	He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them
daenerys	He sang to them?
barristan	Yes Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then hed sing Just like all the other minstrels
daenerys	And what did you do?
barristan	I made sure no one killed him And I collected the money Well he liked to see how much he could make
daenerys	He was good?
barristan	He was very good Viserys never told you?
daenerys	He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people
barristan	Rhaegar never liked killing He loved singing
daenerys	And what did you do with the money?
barristan	Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom One time we got horribly drunk
dario	Your Grace Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber
daenerys	How many others are there?
dario	Fifty a hundred
daenerys	Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?
dario	I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq
daenerys	I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq Go, Ser Barristan Sing a song for me
barristan	Your Grace
hizdahr	All men must die But not all can die in glory
missandei	Glory?
hizdahr	Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on Its the best chance theyll ever have
daenerys	Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
hizdahr	Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season
daenerys	I do not recognize this tradition
hizdahr	Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment I cant promise this is the answer to all our problems, but its a start
hizdahr	I am so sorry, my queen He was a good man
daenerys	Barristan the Bold they called him He crossed a continent to serve me He was a loyal friend And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks
daario	We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide
daenerys	I prefer your earlier suggestion Round up the leaders of each of Meereens great families and bring them to me
hizdahr	But Im the leader of my family
hizdahr	No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this Your Grace
daenerys	Walk forward
man	You cannot do this
daenerys	Another step
daenerys	They will eat you, if I tell them to They may eat you even if I don’t Children Some say I should give up on them But a good mother never gives up on her children She disciplines them if she must
daenerys	But she does not give up on them
daenerys	Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide
hizdahr	All men must die
daenerys	Dont want to overfeed them Tomorrow perhaps
sam	And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slavers Bay, forces rise against her from within and without She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure She sounds like quite a woman
aemon	And shes alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying
sam	Dont say that, Maester Aemon
aemon	A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing
jon	Maester Aemon
aemon	Lord Commander
jon	Sam, Id like to speak to the maester alone
jon	How are you feeling?
aemon	Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death
jon	I need your advice Theres something I want to do, something I have to do But itll divide the Nights Watch Bitterly Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order
aemon	Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander Do it
jon	But you dont know what it is
aemon	That doesnt matter You do You will find little joy in your command But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done Kill the boy, Jon Snow Winter is almost upon us Kill the boy, and let the man be born
jon	Where are the rest of the free folk now? Where have they gone? Who leads them?
tormund	They followed Mance They wont follow anyone else
jon	What about you?
tormund	Hard to lead when youre in chains
jon	What if I unchained you?
tormund	Why would you do that?
jon	Because you are not my enemy And Im not yours
tormund	You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends
jon	For 8,000 years the Nights Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men And for 8,000 years weve fallen short of that oath You belong to the realms of men All of you
tormund	And now everything is going to change?
jon	It is
tormund	Why now?
jon	Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Nights Watch
tormund	What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?
jon	Id have you go north of the Wall Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here Ill open the gates for them and let them through Ill find them lands to settle south of the Wall
tormund	They wont kneel for you and neither will I
jon	I dont want them to kneel for me I want them to fight with me when the time comes
tormund	The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them
jon	And how many of your people cant fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? Youre condemning them to death Worse than death because youre too proud to make peace Or maybe youre not proud Maybe youre just a coward
tormund	Easy thing to say to a man in chains
jon	Your people need a leader And they need to get south of the Wall before its too late We dont have much time and they have less The walkers are coming and theyll hit your people first Im not asking you to make peace to save your skin Make peace to save your people
tormund	Most of them are at Hardhome You know where that is?
jon	Up on Storrolds Point I can give you 10 horses and nine other men You can get there in a week
tormund	Well need ships
jon	Ill talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet
tormund	All right, then Youre coming with me Youre the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch They need to hear it from you They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea You come with me, or I dont go
man	Youd bring wildlings here, through our gates?
jon	Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing
man	Let them die We got our own to worry about Less enemies for us
stannis	Fewer
davos	What?
stannis	Nothing
sam	There is good farmland in the Gift Land that no one uses now A dozen abandoned villages
man	And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years Cut them down! Just like they did this boys people
allister	Weve been fighting them all for thousands of years Theyve slaughtered villages Theyve slaughtered our brothers
jon	And weve slaughtered theirs
edd	I will follow you anywhere, you know that But they killed Grenn And they killed Pyp They killed 50 of our brothers I cant forget that I cant forgive it
jon	You were at the Fist of the First Men If we abandon them, you know what they become We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead Whatever they are now, theyre better than that
jon	Thank you Olly If you have something you want to say to me, say it Its all right
olly	You dont mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace Youre just doing it to trick them
jon	Its not a trick
olly	They burned my village They put an arrow through my fathers head right in front of me They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew
jon	I know what its like to lose the people you love I know this is hard for you But winter is coming We know whats coming with it We cant face it alone
olly	Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?
jon	No
podrick	Shes far away from the Lannisters This is her home Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here
brienne	Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansas in danger even if she doesnt realize it
brienne	Thank you Youve lived here a long time?
man	Aye
brienne	Did you know Lord Eddard?
man	I knew him and his father before him The Starks are gone now
brienne	Not all of them I know whos inside that castle
man	Everyone knows The Boltons
brienne	Im not talking about the Boltons I need to get a message to her To Sansa Stark
man	Who are you?
brienne	Someone who swore to keep her safe
man	Swore to who?
brienne	Her mother
man	Her mothers dead
brienne	That doesnt release me from an oath I served Lady Catelyn I serve her still Who do you serve?

walda	It must be difficult for you being in a strange place
sansa	This isnt a strange place This is my home Its the people who are strange
ramsay	Youre right Very strange More wine, please
ramsay	I heard you two had reunited A fitting place for it I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room Are you still angry with him after he what he did? Dont worry The North remembers I punished him for it Hes not ironborn anymore Not Theon Greyjoy anymore Hes a new man A new person, anyway Arent you, Reek?
theon	Yes, master
ramsay	Thats his new name, Reek
sansa	Why are you doing this?
ramsay	Because Reek has something to say to you Dont you, Reek? An apology Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did Apologize for murdering her two brothers

roose	From the way shes carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy
ramsay	How can you be sure?
roose	Sure of what?
ramsay	That shes pregnant I mean how can you tell?
roose	Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt
ramsay	So how did you manage it?
roose	Manage what?
ramsay	Getting her pregnant
roose	I imagine youre familiar with the procedure
ramsay	Of course, but how did you find it?
roose	You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl
ramsay	And if its a boy?
roose	Youre worried about your position
ramsay	My position is quite clear Im your son until a better alternative comes along
roose	Youve never asked me about your mother
ramsay	Why would I? She had me, she died And here we are
roose	She was a peasant girl Pretty in a common sort of way She was the millers wife Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying She fought me the whole time She was lucky I didnt hang her, too A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms A baby she claimed was mine I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now You are my son Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black But he wont stay for long He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to Kings Landing comes right through Winterfell He means to take the North But the North is ours Its yours and mine Will you help me defeat him?
ramsay	Yes
gilly	Is this every book there is?
sam	Every book there is?
gilly	In the world
sam	Well, no There are thousands and thousands of books out there This library is rather small, actually
gilly	Where you grew up, were there more books?
sam	My fathers not the most literate man They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world
gilly	Wheres that?
sam	The Citadel? In Oldtown
gilly	Im sorry I dont know things
sam	Gilly, look at me You know how to do a hundred things I can never do You can build a fire with wet wood You can cook You can stitch a wound
gilly	I can wash the linens I can sweep the floor
sam	Well
gilly	Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
sam	Its where they train the maesters
gilly	Like Maester Aemon?
sam	I wanted to be one when I was young Instead, I became a man of the Nights Watch Far more adventure up here anyway I wouldnt have met you
sam	Ah, Your Grace
stannis	Youre Samwell Tarly?
sam	I am, Your Grace
stannis	Your father is Randyll Tarly He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford Only battle Robert ever lost I told him he shouldnt go so far west so soon, but he never listened Fine soldier, your father You dont look like a soldier But Im told you killed a white walker
sam	I did, Your Grace
stannis	How?
sam	With a dagger made of dragonglass
stannis	Dragonglass?
sam	What the maesters call obsidian
stannis	I know what it is We have it in Dragonstone Why would obsidian kill a walker?
sam	I dont know Ive been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all Ive learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass
stannis	The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall
sam	Ive seen it, Your Grace
stannis	Seen what?
sam	The army of the dead And when they come
stannis	We have to know how to fight them Keep reading, Samwell Tarly
stannis	Its time
davos	Uh, Your Grace Wouldnt it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men
stannis	If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings We cant wait that long We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested But every day we wait, the odds shift in Boltons favor This could turn to winter at any moment We have to act now Give the order We march at sunrise
davos	Ill choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess
stannis	No need, theyre coming with us
davos	Its a tough road ahead, Your Grace Wont they be safer
stannis	Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists No, they march with us
davos	As you wish, Your Grace
shireen	Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
davos	Beg your pardon?
shireen	At Winterfell All the Kings in the North are buried there Bran the Builder and King Dorren and
davos	First things first Its a long march ahead And then we have to take the castle
shireen	Is there going to be a battle?
davos	Aye, princess, but you wont be anywhere near
selyse	Thats enough talk of battle, Ser Davos Youll scare the child
davos	Yes, my queen
shireen	Im not scared
davos	Well, I am When the battle comes, promise youll protect me
shireen	I promise
stannis	I hope you know what youre doing with these wildlings I need those ships
jon	Youll get them back, I swear it Have a safe journey, Your Grace And thank you
missandei	Youre still too weak
grey worm	How long have I been here?
missandei	Three days
grey worm	Ser Barristan?
grey worm	I failed him I failed my men, I failed my queen
missandei	You failed no one You fought bravely You’ll fight again Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered There was no way you could have known
grey worm	This is not why Wounded in war, there is no shame for this I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid
missandei	All men fear death
grey worm	No, not death I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath
missandei	Now you have given the Masters what they deserve
daenerys	If I give everyone what they deserve, Ill have no one left to rule Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself What do you think?
missandei	Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters
daenerys	You are as fit as anyone I know You know why Im here And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart So what do you think?
missandei	I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace I have seen you listen to your counselors I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice One that only you could see
hizdahr	My, my queen, please do not do this
daenerys	What about Valar Morghulis ?
hizdahr	I did not want to die a coward Apparently I do not want to die at all
daenerys	It takes courage to admit fear And to admit a mistake I came here to tell you that I was wrong I was wrong and you were right About tradition About bringing the people of this city together I will reopen the fighting pits To free men only Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live
hizdahr	Yes, my queen
daenerys	And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees
tyrion	Dont worry Ill be fine Nothing broken, I dont think Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face The Mormont way Lets start over I apologize for before My mouth sometimes runs away from me This doesnt have to be an unpleasant trip Were going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen
jorah	We are
tyrion	What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine
jorah	No wine
tyrion	I am a person who drinks People who drink need to keep drinking Otherwise, theyre not
tyrion	I know where we are Youre taking us through Valyria
jorah	I am
tyrion	Have you sailed this route before?
jorah	No
tyrion	Youre going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case Im not enough?
jorah	I think youll be plenty
tyrion	You know what they say The Doom still rules Valyria What about the demons and the flames? Arent you afraid of the Doom?
jorah	No But the pirates are
tyrion	Oh
tyrion	The Smoking Sea How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything And then
jorah	And then they werent
tyrion	"And then they werent They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"
jorah	"The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned"
tyrion	I would clap
tyrion	I suppose this is it, then This is what remains
tyrion	What was that?
jorah	Stone Men! Dont let them touch you
jorah	Get behind
tyrion	Mormont, cut me free! Mormont
tyrion	Mormont! Mormont
jorah	Tyrion? Tyrion Tyrion Tyrion Youre all right
jorah	Youre heavier than you look Did any of them touch you?
tyrion	You? Ive seen greyscale before, but nothing like that
jorah	I suppose thats why they send them there
tyrion	Itd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it Thank you for saving me Of course, I wouldnt have needed saving if you hadnt kidnapped me in the first place So what now?
jorah	We walk, up the coast With luck, well find a fishing village Maybe another boat
tyrion	Without luck?
jorah	Weve got a long walk ahead of us Ill get some wood for a fire Try to get some rest, huh?
arya	What are they doing with the bodies?
waif	Get back to work
arya	No! I’ve been here for weeks I’m not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I’m doing it
waif	You will know why
arya	When?
waif	When it’s time Not before Get back to work
arya	When do I get to play the game?
waif	Game?
arya	The game The game of faces
waif	You tried already You failed
arya	I didn’t even know I was playing
waif	Who are you?
arya	No one
waif	Get back to work
arya	Well who are you? What are you doing here? How’d you get here?
waif	I’m from Westeros Just like you Daughter of a Lord Just like you Except I was an only child Heir to his fortune My mother died My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl My stepmother didn’t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again I’ve been serving them ever since
beat waif	Was that true or a lie?
arya	What?
waif	Did you believe every word I said?
waif	Get back to work
jaqen	Who are you?
jaqen	Who are you?
arya	Arya
jaqen	And where did you come from?
arya	Westeros My family home is Winterfell I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord Eddard Stark He died in battle
jaqen	A lie
arya	After he was executed I fled the capital Had to kill a stable boy Drove my sword through his back
jaqen	A lie
arya	I stabbed him in the gut I tried to find my mother and brother I never did They were murdered by Walder Frey An outlaw kidnapped me A man called Polliver
jaqen	A lie
arya	A man called the Hound Sandor Clegane He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t I left him in the mountains to die I wanted him to suffer, I hated him
arya	I hated him
arya	I hated him
arya	That’s not a lie
jaqen	The girl lies To me To the Many Faced God To herself Does she truly want to be no one?
arya	Yes
arya	I’m not playing this stupid game anymore
jaqen	We never stop playing
tyrion	So, those villages we were supposed to find We can’t live on berries and roots
jorah	I can
tyrion	You’re not hungry?
jorah	Of course I’m hungry
tyrion	You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met
jorah	I am not your travelling companion
tyrion	We are travelling together In each other’s company Therefore
jorah	Do you ever shut up?
tyrion	I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate Without ever saying a word
jorah	Why?
tyrion	Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis
jorah	I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities
tyrion	I killed my father He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit And he was fucking the woman I loved
tyrion	As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man
jorah	What do you know about my father?
tyrion	I met him I visited the Wall When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them He actually cared about the people in his command How did they put it in the Watch? We shall never see his like again
tyrion	You didn’t know I’m sorry I am
jorah	How?
tyrion	I only know what I heard
jorah	How?
tyrion	He was leading an expedition beyond the wall There was a mutiny He was murdered by his own men
jorah	We better keep moving
man	Valar morghulis
arya	Valar dohaeris
man	I have nowhere else to go I’ve taken her to every healer in Braavos I’ve spent every penny I had She suffers every day of her life I just want it to end
girl	It hurts
arya	I know Don’t be afraid I used to be like you I was sick I was dying But my father never gave up on me He loved me More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you So he brought me here My father prayed to the many faced god And I drank the water from this fountain It healed me
arya	I’ve devoted my life to him now You don’t want to hurt anymore Drink
jaqen	Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?
jaqen	No The girl is not ready to become no one But she is ready to become someone else
tyrion	Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion
jorah	Do you believe in anything?
tyrion	I believe in many things
jorah	In something greater than ourselves, I mean The Gods Destiny Do you believe theres a plan for this world?
tyrion	No
jorah	Neither did I I was a cynic, just like you Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones Instead I found her Daenerys Alive and unhurt Holding her baby dragons Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?
tyrion	No
jorah	Its hard to be a cynic after that
tyrion	Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen
jorah	No it doesn’t
tyrion	The Targaryens are famously insane What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?
jorah	First we have to conquer the world
tyrion	We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf She hacks off my head and restores your position You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne Hurrah, long live the Queen Then what?
jorah	Then she rules
tyrion	So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
jorah	She is the rightful heir
tyrion	Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?
jorah	Shh! It’s a slave ship
tyrion	Why is it anchored?
jorah	They probably came ashore for-
malko	water
malko	Got a lot of fight in you, huh?
slaver	Salt mines
malko	That or a galley slave He looks strong enough
slaver	What about the dwarf?
malko	Worthless Cut his throat
tyrion	Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this
malko	And then chop off his cock We can sell it for a fortune A dwarf’s cock has magic powers
tyrion	Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it He has to know it came from a dwarf And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?
slaver	It will be a dwarf-sized cock
tyrion	Guess again
malko	The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant
jorah	Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery
malko	We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay Besides, she reopened the fighting pits I never heard of free men fighting in the pits
tyrion	The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms
tyrion	Him
malko	Him? He’s got to be 60 years old
tyrion	Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long We can all see that But he is a veteran of 100 battles They wrote songs about him
malko	Is that true?
tyrion	He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself
tyrion	ingslayer
malko	Jousting You’re talking about jousting A fancy game for fancy lads The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole
jorah	I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat
malko	Liar
jorah	It’s no lie His name was Qotho He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo Take me to Slaver’s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I’ll prove my worth
lancel	Lord Baelish
littlefinger	Yes? Lancel Lannister
lancel	Brother Lancel We abandoned our family names
littlefinger	That’s quite a family to abandon
lancel	The city has changed since you were here last We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run
littlefinger	Well done
littlefinger	I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother Should I send word that I’ll be delayed?
lancel	Step carefully, Lord Baelish You’ll find that there’s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King’s Landing
littlefinger	We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel Mine just happen to be entertaining
littlefinger	Do you think it’s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?
cersei	The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden
littlefinger	Of course And the Faith were armed on your orders
cersei	ing’s orders Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?
littlefinger	House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults
cersei	House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys
littlefinger	One’s choice of companion is a curious thing
cersei	Most curious Lysa Arryn for instance A sorrily repellent woman Forgive me I know you’re still in mourning
littlefinger	Lysa was a good woman A kind woman
cersei	She was neither of those things, we both know it Still, I pity her son How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him
littlefinger	I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age
cersei	If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
littlefinger	Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne
cersei	Good If there’s nothing else
littlefinger	There is another matter, your Grace Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven You once charged me with finding Arya Stark To my shame I failed you But I have found Sansa Stark Alive, and well, and home again In Winterfell
cersei	That’s not possible
littlefinger	My sources are well placed They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen
cersei	Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father
littlefinger	Indeed As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart
cersei	We were fools to trust a turncloak
littlefinger	Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house
cersei	I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil
littlefinger	I would counsel patience, your grace
cersei	Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor
littlefinger	Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives
cersei	Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here The weather has already begun to turn
littlefinger	That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force
cersei	My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse
littlefinger	Ser Jaime, then
cersei	Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission I’ve no idea when he’ll be back
littlefinger	Perhaps I can help nights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow
cersei	Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man
littlefinger	You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?
cersei	And if you succeed?
littlefinger	Name me Warden of the North
cersei	I’ll speak to the king this evening Have him issue a royal decree
littlefinger	I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell
cersei	And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike
littlefinger	As I said I live to serve
trystane	I’m going to ask him tomorrow
myrcella	What if he says no?
trystane	He won’t You’ve waited long enough I want you to be my wife now What is it?
myrcella	Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you
myrcella	We can’t Not yet
trystane	Why not?
myrcella	You know why not Someone will see
trystane	You are going to be my wife I am going to be your husband We are allowed to walk through the gardens together
myrcella	How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
trystane	I like the way your eyes go squinty when you’re jealous
myrcella	They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question
doran	They make a lovely couple A Lannister and a Martell They have no idea how dangerous that is We must protect them
areo	Yes, my prince
doran	You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time I hope you remember how
areo	I remember how
bronn	The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach.
jaime	Alright, thats enough
bronn	I’m coming to the best part
jaime	We’re trying to blend in We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent
bronn	This song really is all about the ending
jaime	It can wait Up there
jaime	That’s the Water Gardens
bronn	Once we got the princess, then what?
jaime	I like to improvise
bronn	That explains the golden hand
ellaria	Unbowed, unbent, unbroken For Oberyn
sand snakes	For Oberyn
bronn	Well, she’s made herself at home
jaime	Myrcella
myrcella	Uncle Jaime? I don’t understand, what are you doing here?
jaime	Let’s speak in private
trystane	I am Trystane Martell
myrcella	Trystane is my intended
jaime	Excellent Good to meet you
trystane	We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime
bronn	Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son?
bronn	Let’s not do something stupid
myrcella	No
bronn	That was something stupid
jaime	We have to go, Myrcella, now
myrcella	You hurt him
jaime	You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to-
bronn	Oh for fuck’s sake
obara	You’re coming with me
myrcella	I don’t want to
obara	I wasn’t asking, princess
areo	Drop you weapons
obara	I am Obara Sand Daughter of Oberyn Martell I fight for Dorne Who do you fight for?
areo	Drop your weapons
areo	When you were whole, it would have been a good fight
bronn	You fight pretty good for a little girl
rider	Halt
olenna	Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away Well, why are we stopped, go on
olenna	Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got It’s theater, nothing more If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else
margaery	Everyone knew about him and Renly
olenna	Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms Everyone knew No one cared
margaery	But he was the king’s brother
olenna	And Loras is the queen’s brother No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable
margaery	Cersei is behind this
olenna	Of course she is She wants to drag our names through the dirt Put us in our place Get some rest, dear, you look appalling Let me deal with Cersei Lannister
olenna	Your Grace, I have travelled a long way
cersei	You must be exhausted
olenna	Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything
cersei	Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns
olenna	And the famous tart Queen Cersei
cersei	Beg your pardon
olenna	I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson
cersei	If you apologize for that comment perhaps-
olenna	You’ll get your apology when I get Loras
cersei	I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras I have no love for these fanatics But what can the queen mother do?
olenna	Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?
cersei	I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains-
olenna	Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?
cersei	As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone As for your veiled threats-
olenna	What veil?
cersei	The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
olenna	I didn’t trust your father I didn’t particularly like him But I respected him He was no fool He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them
cersei	House Lannister has no rival The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened Good day, Lady Olenna
high sparrow	You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
loras	I don’t pay attention to rumors
sparrow	You were said to be despondent when he died Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis
army closed in loras	He was my friend He was my king
sparrow	Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly
loras	I was wrong to support Renly’s claim I know that But I was forgiven by Joffrey I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater
sparrow	Wearing Renly’s armor
loras	Why does it matter what I wore?
sparrow	Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy
loras	Of course I deny them
sparrow	You never lay with Renly Baratheon
loras	Never
sparrow	Nor any other man
loras	Never
sparrow	That will be all Ser Loras
olenna	Well I think that’s quite enough of that
sparrow	Faith calls Queen Margaery forward
margaery	You call me forward?
sparrow	Yes We have some questions for you
margaery	I am the queen
sparrow	You are And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest
sparrow	How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
margaery	They are lies
sparrow	All of them?
margaery	All of them
sparrow	Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?
margaery	Yes, I swear it
sparrow	Thank you, your grace
sparrow	Do you know this man?
olyvar	Yes, very well He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden
sparrow	How did you come to meet?
olyvar	I squired for him He took a liking to me He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met
sparrow	And what occurred in his chamber?
olyvar	We engaged in intimate relations
sparrow	You laid with him?
olyvar	That night and many others
loras	Liar! He’s a liar
sparrow	Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
olyvar	Yes, yes, Queen Margaery She walked in on us once not long ago She didn’t seem surprised
cersei	This testimony is an insult to a great house Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
olyvar	He has a birthmark, your grace Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne
loras	Liar
olenna	What are you doing? Let us pass
sparrow	The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery
margaery	What?
sparrow	Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any Take her
margaery	Tommen! Tommen
margaery	You can’t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you
sansa	What do you want?
myranda	Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don’t you?
myranda	You’re so beautiful But if you need to keep him happy Ramsay gets bored easily You dont want to end up like Well, like the others

sansa	Do you think I care what he does to you
roose	Who comes before the Old Gods this night?

ramsay	Are you pleased my lady?
ramsay	Good I want you to be happy My father said you’re still a virgin

sansa	Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me
ramsay	You’re not lying to me?
sansa	No, my lord
ramsay	Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don’t you think?
sansa	Yes sir
ramsay	Good Now take off your clothes
ramsay	Oh, no no no You stay here Reek You watch Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time
ramsay	Reek? I told you to watch
jon	First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black
alliser	Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings

sam	Oh, and
sam	It’s Dragonglass It’s what I used to kill the White Walker I hope you don’t need them

aemon	Get him south, Gillyflower Before it’s too late
sansa	Theon, wait

theon	Please
sansa	You betrayed my family
theon	I’m sorry I’m sorry
sansa	You have to help me
theon	He’ll see us You don’t know him
sansa	My family still has friends in the North All I have to do is give a signal and they’ll rescue me Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window Promise me, Theon
theon	Reek, my lady, Reek
sansa	Your name is Theon Greyjoy Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon Promise me
ramsay	Yes, Reek?
aemon	Egg! Egg! Mothers looking for you! Egg

sam	You don’t know that
gilly	Get some sleep I’ll watch over him
sam	I’ll stay too He’s always been good to me I can’t leave him now
aemon	Egg! Egg I dreamed that I was old
sam	His name was Aemon Targaryen He came to us from King’s Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn And a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch, ever faithful No man was wiser or gentler or kinder At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out And now his watch has ended
brothers	And now his watch has ended
alliser	You’re losing all your friends, Tarly
ramsay	My beautiful wife
ramsay	When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You’ve made me very happy
ramsay	Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell He’s a respected commander His troops are loyal and battle tested He’s hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners Our people are used to fighting in frost His army’s out there now, suffering in the snow One day I’ll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North You’ll be my Lady and Wardeness
sansa	But isn’t your step mother pregnant?
ramsay	What of it?
sansa	What happens if she has a boy?
ramsay	Then I’ll have a baby brother
sansa	But he’ll be the heir
ramsay	I’m Lord Bolton’s eldest son
sansa	But you’re a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim
ramsay	I’ve been naturalized by a royal decree of-
sansa	Tommen Baratheon Another bastard
ramsay	Bastards can rise high in the world Like your half-brother Jon Snow Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch
ramsay	You didn’t know? Yes, he’s done very well for himself Ah I near forgot why I asked you to join me Come, my lady
ramsay	Your Northern friend Reek told me you wanted to leave
ramsay	Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband
ramsay	Tough old bird Everyone talks when I start beating them But this one Her heart gave out before I got to her face We do breed them tough in the North Bring my wife back to her chamber It’s far too cold out here for a lady You should hold on to your candles The nights are so long now
davo davos	40 horses died in the night We’ll lose more come sunset We’re running out of food We can’t open the supply line until the snow clears
stannis	What else?
davos	The Stormcrows rode off last night
stannis	500 men
stannis	Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold
davos	We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won’t be marching anywhere in this weather
stannis	And?
davos	This isn’t our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears
stannis	I retreated from King’s Landing, Ser Davos If I retreat again, I become ing Who Ran
davos	Your Grace
stannis	Winter is coming Those arent just the Stark words, it’s a fact If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black And who can say how many years this winter will last
davos	It’s better to wait for the right time than to risk everything
stannis	This is the right time, and I will risk everything Because if I dont, we’ve lost We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward
davos	Your Grace
stannis	I’ve trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years
melisandre	You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames A great battle in the snow
stannis	I don’t know what I saw
melisandre	You do know Trust yourself
stannis	And you, do you trust yourself?
melisandre	I trust in the Lord
stannis	Are you sure?
melisandre	I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground
melisandre	But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory I have shown you the power of kings blood The Usurper Robb Stark The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon
stannis	We don’t have Robert’s bastard here
melisandre	No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins
stannis	Have you lost your mind?
melisandre	Do you doubt me still? After all that you’ve seen?
stannis	There must be another way Leeches or something
melisandre	There is only one way You must become king before the Long Night begins Only you can lead the living against the dead All your life has led us to this moment To this decision
stannis	She’s my daughter
stannis	Get out
derryk	The beauty from beyond The Wall
brand	Where are you going, huh? Aren’t we better looking than the fat man?

derryk	Come on love, give us a kiss
gilly	Leave me alone

sam	Oh Oh my
malko	A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate This one’s a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts Bidding begins at 12 gold honors
malko	13 Do I have 14?
malko	15? 15 golds honors Do I have 16?
slave buyer	20
malko	Sold
tyrion	Wait! You have to buy me as well
buyer	Why?
tyrion	We’re a team I’m a great fighter, too
malko	He’s funny You have to give him that
buyer	Alright He’s funny
tyrion	Thank you my Lord Thank you
buyer	Yes
tyrion	My Lord, if I may I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage
buer	Here’s your wages, funny man It’ll last the rest of your life
daario	How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
daenerys	Don’t be ridiculous My marriage to Hizdahr is political I think he’s smart enough to understand that
daario	I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king
daenerys	Are you jealous?
daario	Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
daenerys	I do
daario	You’re right My motivations are entirely impure
daario	Doesn’t make me wrong
daenerys	You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me I have no choice
daario	Everyone has a choice Even slaves have a choice Death or slavery
daenerys	So what else can I do?
daario	Marry me instead
daenerys	Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t
daario	Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like
daenerys	No I can
t daario	Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free
daario	I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?
daenerys	Of course
daario	On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all
daenerys	I am a queen Not a butcher
daario	All rulers are either butchers or meat
olenna	You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got
high sparrow	It’s not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I’ll admit
olenna	You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady
sparrow	You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
olenna	Don’t spar with me little fellow
sparrow	For me, it’s the knees You?
olenna	Hips
sparrow	Huh
olenna	A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game dull and unconvincing A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her
sparrow	The people always do the dirty work
olenna	Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away
sparrow	A useful talent
olenna	I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter
sparrow	Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied The Father judges us all Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen If you break his laws you will be punished
olenna	Don’t you walk away from me
sparrow	You don’t give commands here, Lady Olenna
olenna	What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived
olenna	What then?
sparrow	I imagine this is strange for you Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out But I’m telling you a simple truth I serve the gods The gods demand justice
olenna	How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
sparrow	By the holy text The seven pointed star If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own
olenna	I’ve read the seven pointed star
sparrow	Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws
olenna	Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?
sparrow	Yes The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally
olenna	If it’s equality you want then so be it When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame
sparrow	Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye You are the few We are the many And when the many stop fearing the few
squire	Lady Olenna
cersei	Starving yourself wont make things any better for her, my love
tommen	She’s in a prison cell and there’s nothing I can do I am the king! The queen is in prison and there’s nothing I can do
cersei	No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, youll face circumstances beyond your control Events you couldnt possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had You cannot blame yourself for fate Your father, your brother, your grandfather I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? Hold them as they left this world Kissed their heads after theyd gone
tommen	I’ll call in the army I’ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them I’ll start a war if I have to
cersei	You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be
tommen	I love her I love her I can’t help her
cersei	We must be strong for those we love We cannot give in to despair
tommen	I will speak to the high sparrow There must be something-
cersei	Let me speak to him on your behalf The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic
cersei	Your happiness is all I want in this world
tommen	I know
cersei	No you don’t You can’t possibly Not until you have children of your own I would do anything for you Anything to keep you from harm I would burn cities to the ground That is all that matters You and your sister From the moment you came into this world, my boy My only boy
areo	Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess’s wellbeing
myrcella	You looked different when I left You had more hair
jaime	And more hands How’s Trystane?
myrcella	He’ll be alright
jaime	I’m sorry for that It wasn’t supposed to happen that way
myrcella	Why is it happening at all?
jaime	Your mother’s worried about you Threats have been made Dorne is too dangerous for you I’ve come to take you home
myrcella	This is my home, this has been my home for years I didn’t want to come here but she told me to I did what she said, I did my duty and now she’s forcing me to go back?
jaime	Its for your own good These are complicated matters
myrcella	It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here
jaime	I don’t understand
myrcella	Of course you don’t! You don’t know me
bronn	Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife
tyene	He’s got a good voice
obara	We’re lucky he’s a singer If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble
bronn	It’s against my code to hurt a woman
obara	It’s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code
bronn	I wouldn’t say you beat me
tyene	How’s your arm?
bronn	Wonderful Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar
tyene	You think you’re leaving Dorne?
bronn	No great hurry Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world
tyene	Thank you
bronn	I said Dornish women I didn’t say you
tyene	I’m not the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen?
bronn	I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms
tyene	Name one more beautiful than I am
bronn	Well now, in King’s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous.
tyene	There was a what? In King’s Landing you were saying
bronn	Was I?
tyene	There was a woman more beautiful than I am
bronn	Was there? My memory’s not what it was earlier
tyene	How’s your arm now?
bronn	You seem concerned with it You must really like me
tyene	And how about your head?
bronn	My head You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in
tyene	Your nose is bleeding
bronn	It’s nothing It’s the dry air
tyene	My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei They call it the Long Farewell It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death
tyene	The only antidote Who’s the most beautiful woman in the world?
tyene	Sorry? Who?
bronn	You
tyene	Don’t drop it
tyene	I think you’re very handsome as well
littlefinger	I’m sorry about the locale
olenna	No you’re not
littlefinger	It felt like the safest place
olenna	Not for your clientele, clearly
littlefinger	It was an establishment like no other The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them
olenna	You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?
littlefinger	The past is the past The future is all that’s worth discussing The future of House Tyrell
olenna	Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong
littlefinger	I promise you
olenna	I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined Together we murdered a king And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you So do you deny a part in all of this?
littlefinger	Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing I dared not refuse her
olenna	And what did she want?
littlefinger	A piece of info that she know that I had Neither silence nor lies were an option But I have other information of which she is unaware And as you say, our interests are aligned I have a gift for you
olenna	What kind of gift?
littlefinger	The same kind I gave Cersei A handsome young man
slave owner	Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something
owner	You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you
owner	Valar morghulis
men	Valar dohaeris
owner	Prepare yourselves
daenerys	Sitting through the great games will be bad enough
hizdahr	For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence
owner	Move yourselves
owner	Your Grace Your Future Grace You honor us all
owner	We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen
men	We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen
daenerys	I think I’ve seen enough
hizdahr	Your Grace, it’s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged
daenerys	I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions
tyrion	What are you doing?
daenerys	Get him out of my sight
jorah	Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time I brought you a gift
tyrion	It’s true He has
daenerys	Who are you?
tyrion	I am the gift It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace My name is Tyrion Lannister
cersei	This is horrible Unacceptable Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this Venison It’s quite good I had it myself for supper only last night We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind
margaery	I know you did this
cersei	We are making every effort on your behalf I swear to you by all the seven gods
margaery	Lies come easily to you Everyone knows that But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me
cersei	You’re upset You’re not thinking clearly I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down
margaery	I don’t want to see you again
cersei	I do hope you change your mind about that I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins
margaery	Leave
cersei	Yes, I’m afraid I must My son needs me now more than ever
medicine margaery	Get out you hateful bitch
cersei	Sleep well, sister
high sparrow	Thank you You saw her?
cersei	Yes
sparrow	And?
cersei	Her accommodations seem sufficient What happens to her now?
sparrow	Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith
cersei	Who will stand judge?
sparrow	Seven septons As it was in all trials before the Targaryens
cersei	Will you be one of them?
sparrow	I will
cersei	If one or both of them were to confess before the trial
sparrow	Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy
cersei	What does The Mother’s mercy entail?
sparrow	It depends on the situation The acts themselves, the degree of contrition
cersei	Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven
sparrow	Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?
cersei	I think I may have heard at one point
sparrow	Baelor built his sept around it But men worshipped here long before him
sparrow	Who carved this altar do you know?
cersei	I’m afraid i don’t
sparrow	No one does There’s no name on it Or anywhere else in the chapel The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there Their faith was clean Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains Something simple, solid, and true The Tyrell’s finery will be stripped away Their lives knocked down, their true hearts laid bare for all to see And so it will be for all of us, high and low alike What will we find when we strip away your finery?
sparrow	A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down But piece by piece he unburdened himself Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird
sparrow	And he has much to say about you
cersei	Move Let me go immediately
cersei	You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy I am the queen! Let me go
jorah	Your Grace, I want to say-
daenerys	You will not speak How do I know you are who you say you are?
tyrion	If only I were otherwise
daenerys	If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
tyrion	You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time
daenerys	So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
tyrion	Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service
daenerys	If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word
tyrion	When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world I thought you were worth meeting at the very least
daenerys	And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
tyrion	Because you can not build a better world on your own You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you
daenerys	I have a very large army and very large dragons
tyrion	Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name
daenerys	So you want to advise me Very well What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned
tyrion	I know
daenerys	Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?
tyrion	Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him And yet he did betray you
tyrion	Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
daenerys	Yes, many opportunities
tyrion	And did he?
daenerys	No Not until forced to do so
tyrion	He worships you He is in love with you, I think But he did not trust you with the truth an unpleasant truth, to be sure but one of great significance to you He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him
daenerys	So I should kill him?
tyrion	A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea But you cannot have him by your side when you do
daenerys	Remove Ser Jorah from the city
septa	Confess
cersei	My son Let me speak to-
septa	Confess I meant it
cersei	My face will be the last thing you see before-
arya	My name is Lana I’m an orphan When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more
arya	Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart Now every morning I make my way down to the canals I pass the fish mongers and the bakers I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane-
arya	Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade
jaqen	Lana is very impressive Very industrious She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God
arya	How will she serve him?
jaqen	She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor
arya	What will she do there?
jaqen	She will see
arya	See what?
jaqen	How can a man tell a girl this If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her
arya	Oysters, clams and cockles
arya	Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles
thin man	Your oysters fresh?
arya	Best in the city
thin man	You wouldn’t lie to an old man would you?
thin man	Very nice Give me 4 With vinegar
man	It’s my 18th voyage I’ve returned from all of them without a scratch on me
thin man	Can’t do it
man	Please I have 3 children Without me here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don’t understand?
jaqen	The man is a gambler He wages that his sailors ship will make it to its destination It is a strange wager for the captain He only wins if he loses his life
arya	So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
jaqen	A girl tells a man that she has seen
arya	If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money
jaqen	But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?
arya	The Many Faced God You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks
jaqen	A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not A girl named Lana will return to the docks She will watch the gambler She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself
arya	And then what?
jaqen	A gift for the Thin Man
waif	She is not ready
jaqen	Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not
waif	And if she’s not?
jaqen	It is all the same to the Many Faced God
qyburn	The trial will take place The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you
cersei	The charges?
qyburn	Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert
cersei	All lies
qyburn	Of course, Your Grace My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason
cersei	I wish you’d said it sooner Any word from Jaime?
qyburn	I’m afraid not Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King He now presides over the small council
cersei	Tell him I need to speak to him
qyburn	I implored him to visit you but he would not
cersei	What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king-
qyburn	Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall Left untouched
cersei	You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother
qyburn	I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me He wouldn’t see anyone
cersei	I can’t stay here
qyburn	There is a way, Your Grace A way out
cersei	Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t I made him I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness
qyburn	Goodbye my queen The work continues
sansa	Why Why Theon
theon	Not Theon There is no Theon Reek
sansa	Reek Why did you tell him, Reek?
theon	I was helping you You were trying to escape, there is no escape Not ever Theon Greyjoy tried to escape The master knew He knows everything He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left
sansa	Good If it weren’t for you I’d still have a family If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would
theon	I deserved everything I deserve to be Reek I did terrible things Turned on Robb Captured Winterfell Killed those boys
theon	They weren’t those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon They were your brothers, you’d know them since they were born
theon	They weren’t They were only-
sansa	Only what?
theon	I can’t
sansa	Tell me
theon	I can’t, not unless the master says.
sansa	Tell me, they weren’t what?
theon	They weren’t SANSA Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren’t your brothers
theon	They weren’t Bran and Rickon! I couldn’t find them It was two farm boys I killed them and burned them so no one would know
sansa	You didn’t ?
sansa	Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?
theon	I can’t talk to you anymore
sansa	Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon-
theon	Not Theon, Reek
bolton bannerman	Our scouts tells us he’s got no more than 6000 men More than half of them are mounted, however
roose	And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced We have enough food for six months We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny
roose	You disagree?
ramsay	Stannis isn’t from the North You are, father I think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders
roose	And what do you recommend?
ramsay	That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows
roose	A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to
ramsay	I don’t need an army I need 20 good men
daenerys	So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?
tyrion	Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?
daenerys	It’s probably my safest option
tyrion	I can see why you would think so It’s what your father would have done
daenerys	And what would your father do?
tyrion	My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear
daenerys	Is that why you killed him?
tyrion	Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this
daenerys	I know what my father was What he did I know the Mad King earned his name
tyrion	So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers
daenerys	I’m terrible?
tyrion	I’ve heard stories
daenerys	Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
tyrion	To see if you were the right kind of terrible
daenerys	Which kind is that?
tyrion	The kind that prevents your people from being even more so
daenerys	I did reopen the fighting pits Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment
tyrion	Yes, that was wise And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good Very impressive My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid She ended up having him killed
daenerys	Perhaps it won’t come to that
tyrion	It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all
daenerys	Varys? King Robert’s spy master?
tyrion	Yes He was the one who convinced me to come find you He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself
daenerys	Jorah sent my secrets to Varys For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me
tyrion	He did what he had to do to survive He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib
daenerys	But you trust him?
tyrion	Yes, oddly He might be the only person in the world that I trust Besides my brother
daenerys	The brother who killed my father
tyrion	That’s the one
daenerys	Perhaps I will have you killed after all
tyrion	Your queenly prerogative I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting
daenerys	I’m not going to kill you
tyrion	No? Banish me?
daenerys	No
tyrion	So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished.
daenerys	You’re going to advise me While you can still speak in complete sentences
tyrion	Advise you on what?
daenerys	How to get what I want
tyrion	The Iron Throne Perhaps you should try wanting something else
daenerys	If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool
tyrion	I’m not entirely joking There’s more to the world than Westeros after all How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong Where you can do the most good
daenerys	I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold I will continue that fight here and beyond But this is not my home
tyrion	And when you get back to your home, who supports you?
daenerys	The common people
tyrion	Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours That leaves the Tyrells Not impossible, but not enough
daenerys	Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell They’re all just spokes on a wheel This ones on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground
tyrion	It’s a beautiful dream Stopping the wheel You’re not the first person to have dreamt it
daenerys	I’m not going to stop the wheel I’m going to break the wheel
jorah	You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen I won
master	You struck me
jorah	I’ve been flogged if it makes you happy I’m the best you’ve got If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
master	You’re a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?
jorah	Let me fight for her and I belong to you
septa	Thirsty? Confess
cersei	I’ll get out of here, you realize Before long
septa	Confess
cersei	I can make you a wealthy woman A lady of the court
septa	Confess
cersei	I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die
gilly	Does it hurt?

olly	Wanted to ask you something If you’ve got the time
gilly	I need to check on baby Sam
sam	Now then How can I help?
olly	It’s about the Lord Commander
sam	Yes?
olly	He’s going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings Wildlings killed my mom and dad They killed everyone in my village
sam	We’ve been fighting them for years
olly	This wasn’t a fight We were farmers and they slaughtered us So why’s he saving them?
sam	Wildlings are people, just like us There are good ones and bad ones
olly	The one he’s travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village
sam	Olly.
olly	How can he trust him?
sam	I’ve seen the army of the dead I’ve seen the white walkers, and they’re coming for us, for all the living And when it’s time we’ll need every last man we can find
olly	But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
sam	Jon’s taking a risk, but he has to We don’t stand a chance otherwise Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run
olly	You believe that?
sam	With all my heart
sam	Try not to worry Olly I’ve been worrying about Jon for years He always comes back
tormund	You trust me Jon Snow?

tormund	We are fools together now
tormund	Lord of Bones Been a long time
lord of bones	Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner The other way around now What happened?
tormund	War
lord of bones	You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king
tormund	We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk
lord of bones	You don’t give the orders here
tormund	I’m not giving an order
lord of bones	Why aren’t you in chains?
jon	He’s not my prisoner
lord of bones	What is he?
jon	We’re allies
lord of bones	You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now
tormund	I don’t fight for the crows
jon	We’re not here to fight We’re here to talk
lord of bones	Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund And when you’re done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock-
tormund	Gather the elders and let’s talk
jon	My name’s Jon Snow I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch We’re not friends We’ve never been friends We won’t become friends today This isn’t about friendship This is about survival This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there
karsi	You built that wall to keep us out
loboda	Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?

missandei	I want to see you Please
marwyn	It might be useful Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher
sam	Archmaester, I wanted to -
marwyn	And this one
marwyn	Maester Faol was quite the opposite A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells
sam	I wanted to ask you -
marwyn	If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style Im not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread
marwyn	What? You dont like the title? What would you call it then?
sam	Possibly something a bit more poetic?
marwyn	Were not poets, Tarley
sam	Archmaester, if I could just have a moment
marwyn	This is your moment Use it wisely
sam	I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos
marwyn	Im familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases
sam	Oh, you are?
marwyn	Yes Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale
sam	Oh
marwyn	The procedure is far too dangerous which is why its now forbidden
sam	Hello
jorah	What are you doing?
sam	Youre Jorah Mormont Youre the only son of Jeor Mormont
sam	My name is Samwell Tarley Im a sworn brother of the Nights Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black I knew your father I was with him when he died Youre not dying today, Ser Jorah

jorah	Have you ever done this before?
sam	No No one else will try, so Im the best youve got Have a seat Im going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the -

kings quarters jon	Come in
wolkan	A raven, My King, from the Citadel
great hall jon	This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley He was my brother at the Nights Watch A man I trust as much as anyone in this world Hes discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass
jon	I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister
jon	Hes now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons
jon	Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and Im going to accept
jon	We need this Dragonglass, My Lords We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army We need to mine it and turn it into weapons
jon	But more importantly, we need allies The Night Kings army grows larger by the day We cant defeat them on our own We dont have the numbers Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire I need to try and persuade her to fight with us Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone
sansa	Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to Kings Landing and roasted him alive
jon	I know that
sansa	She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms The north is one of those seven kingdoms This isnt an invitation, its a trap
jon	It could be, but I dont believe Tyrion would do that You know him Hes a good man
yohn royce	Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa I remember the Mad King all too well A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister
robett glover	W calle you brothe king an the h rod sout an los hi kingdom
	Winter is here, Your Grace We need the King in the North in the north
jon	You all crowned me your king I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home Its part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds But the odds are against us None of you have seen the Army of the Dead None of you We can never hope to defeat them alone We need allies, powerful allies I know its a risk But I have to take it
sansa	Then send an emissary Dont go yourself
jon	Daenerys is a queen Only a king can convince her to help us It has to be me
sansa	Youre abandoning your people Your abandoning your home
jon	Im leaving both in good hands
sansa	Whose?
jon	Yours You are my sister You are the only Stark in Winterfell Until I return, the north is yours
littlefinger	I delivered his bones myself I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister It seems like a lifetime ago Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him
littlefinger	I was sorry when he died Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much So did I She wasnt fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North Last best hope against the coming storm
jon	You dont belong down here
littlefinger	Forgive me We have never talked properly I wanted to remedy that
jon	I have nothing to say to you
littlefinger	Not even thank you? If it werent for me youd have been slaughtered at that battlefield You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you Im not one of them I love Sansa as I loved her mother
jon	Touch my sister and Ill kill you myself

yara	He might have to intervene
ellaria	hold that person back
yara	Until theyve made their intentions known

jon	The dwarf of Casterly Rock
tyrion	I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall
jon	You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right You picked up some scars along the road
tyrion	Its been a long road But were both still here
tyrion	Im Tyrion Lannister
davos	Davos Seaworth and DAVOS shake hands
tyrion	Ah, the Onion Knight We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay
davos	Unluckily for me
tyrion	Missandei is the queens most trusted advisor
missandei	Welcome to Dragonstone Our queen knows this is a long journey She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf If you wouldnt mind handing over your weapons
jon	Of course
missandei	Please, this way
davos	Where are you from? I cant place the accent
missandei	I was born on the Island of Naarth
davos	Ah I hear its beautiful down there Palm trees and butterflies I havent been myself
davos	This place has changed
tyrion	And Sansa, I hear shes alive and well
jon	She is
tyrion	Does she miss me terribly?
tyrion	A sham marriage and unconsummated
jon	I didnt ask -
tyrion	Well, it was It wasnt Anyway, shes much smarter than she lets on
jon	Shes starting to let on
tyrion	Good At some point I want to hear how a Knights Watch recruit became King in the North
jon	As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen
tyrion	A long and bloody tale To be honest, I was drunk for most of it
jon	My bannermen think Im a fool for coming here
tyrion	Of course they do If I was your hand I would have advised against it General rule of thumb, Stark men dont fare well when they travel south
jon	True But Im not a Stark
tyrion	Id say you get used to them, but you never really do
tyrion	Come Their mother is waiting for you
varys	I wondered why you werent there to meet our guests You begged us to summon the King in the North Dont you want to see him again?
melisandre	Ive done my part Ive brought ice and fire together
varys	Strange You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff I didnt take you for a bashful girl
melisandre	My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end
varys	Oh, I doubt that Give us common folk one taste of power were like the lion who tasted man Nothing is ever so sweet again
melisandre	Neither of us is common folk anymore I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor
varys	Why?
melisandre	Because of mistakes I made Terrible mistakes I would only be a distraction if I stayed
varys	So where will you go?
melisandre	Volantis
varys	Good If you dont mind my saying, I dont think you should return to Westeros Im not sure youd be safe here
melisandre	I will return, dear spider One last time
varys	My Lady -
melisandre	I have to die in this strange country, just like you
missandei	You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains
davos	This is Jon Snow
davos	Hes King in the North
daenerys	Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords I hope the seas werent too rough
jon	The winds were kind, Your Grace
davos	Apologies I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace Hes not a lord
daenerys	Forgive me -
tyrion	Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth
daerneys	Forgive me, Ser Davos I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity But do I have my facts wrong?
davos	I wasnt there, Your Grace
daenerys	No Of course not But still, an oath is an oath In perpetuity means what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?
tyrion	Forever
daenerys	Forever So I assume, My Lord, that youre here to bend the knee
jon	I am not
daenerys	Oh Well, that is unfortunate Youve travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?
jon	Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive He burned my uncle alive He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms
daenerys	My father was an evil man On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father Our two houses were allies for centuries Those were the best centuries the kingdoms ever known Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it
jon	Youre right Youre not guilty of your fathers crime And Im not beholden to my ancestors vows
daenerys	Then why are you here?
jon	Because I need your help and you need mine
daenerys	Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
jon	I did
daenerys	And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?
jon	Theyre hard to miss
daenerys	But still, I need your help?
davos	Not to defeat Cersei You could storm Kings Landing tomorrow and the city would fall Hell, we almost took it and we didnt even have dragons
tyrion	Almost
jon	But you havent stormed Kings Landing Why not? The only reason I can see is you dont want to kill thousands of innocent people Its the fastest way to win the war but you wont do it Which means at the very least youre better than Cersei
daenerys	Still, that doesnt explain why I need your help
jon	Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, were children playing at a game screaming that the rules arent fair
daenerys	You told me you liked this man
tyrion	I do
daenerys	In the time since hes met me hes refused to call me queen, hes refused to bow and now hes calling me a child
tyrion	I believe hes calling all of us children Figure of speech
jon	Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we dont defeat the enemy to the north
daenerys	As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north
jon	I am not your enemy The dead are the enemy
daenerys	The dead?
daenerys	Is that another figure of speech?
jon	The Army of the Dead is on the march
tyrion	The Army of the Dead?
jon	You dont know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?
tyrion	No, I dont think youre either of those things
jon	The Army of the Dead is real The White Walkers are real night King is real Ive seen them If they get past the wall and were squabbling amongst ourselves -
jon	were finished
daenerys	I was born at Dragonstone Not that I can remember it
daenerys	We fled before Roberts assassins could find us Robert was your fathers best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib Not that it matters now of course I spent my life in foreign lands So many men have tried to kill me I dont remember all of their names I have been sold like a brood mare I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith Not in any gods Not in myths and legends In myself In Daenerys Targaryen The world hadnt seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born The Dothraki hadnt crossed the sea Any sea
daenerys	They did for me I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms And I will
jon	Youll be ruling over a graveyard if we dont defeat the Night King
tyrion	The war against my sister has already begun You cant expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting -
tyrion	whatever you saw beyond the wall
davos	You dont believe him I understand that It sounds like nonsense
davos	But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen He was named Lord Commander of the Nights Watch He was named King in the North Not because of his birthright He has no birthright Hes a damn bastard All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him
davos	All those things you dont believe in, he faced those things He fought those things for the good of his people He risked his life for his people He took a knife in the heart for his people He gave his own -
davos	If we dont put asside our enmities and band together we will die And then it doesnt matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne
tyrion	If it doesnt matter you might as well kneel
tyrion	Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north
jon	Theres no time for that Theres no time for any of this While we stand here debating -
tyrion	It takes no time to bend the knee Pledge your sword to her cause
jon	And why would I do that?
jon	I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I dont know you As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your fathers name And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them And I will continue to do so as well as I can
daenerys	Thats fair Its also fair to point out that Im the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion
daenerys	You must forgive my manners You will both be tired after your long journey Well have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms
jon	Am I your prisoner?
daenerys	Not yet
varys	Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne
daenerys	And?
varys	Two or three ships escaped The rest sunk our captured Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured The Greyjoys are dead or captured
daenerys	All of them?

theon	Euron has her
captain	You saw him take her? And you got away?
theon	I couldnt save her I tried
captain	You wouldnt be here if you tried

euron	I have to be honest, its making me hard Did you see little Theons face right before he jumped overboard?
euron	Oh no
euron	What a twat
euron	My queen Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands
euron	I give you -
euron	what no other man could give Justice Justice for your murdered daughter
cersei	Youve proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown
euron	A bit more than a true friend
cersei	And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism
euron	Theres only one reward I want
cersei	You shall have what your heart desires -
cersei	when the war is won
cersei	With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country
euron	Theres nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people I suppose you wouldnt know
jaime	This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, theyll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike
euron	Or yours They just like severed heads really Listen, if you have any advice at all Id love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers
jaime	Advice?
euron	Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
euron	Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now Well talk later
cut to	RED KEEP
cersei	I want you to know I understand Even though were enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lovers head I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyns skull breaking
cersei	The sound of your scream I never heard a sound like that I thought, thats true love Oberyn looked beautiful that day He really did No one moved like him No one had such skill with a spear Even Ser Gregor couldnt stop him If only he hadnt taunted him He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die But that wasnt your lovers way, was it? Now hes burried somewhere And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever That must be difficult for you When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you cant imagine how that feels unless youve lost a child I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse I couldnt bear to see her in another womans arms I never got to have a mother But Myrcella did She was mine and you took her from me Why did you do that?
cersei	It doesnt matter now
cersei	Your daughter is a beauty too Brown eyes, those lips A perfect Dornish beauty
cersei	I imagine she is your favorite
cersei	I know, I know, were not supposed to have favorites But still, were only human We love who we love
cersei	Im sorry I cant understand you The gag makes it difficult to understand what youre saying It must be frustrating
cersei	We all make our choices You chose to murder my daughter You must have felt powerful after you made that choice
cersei	Do you feel powerful now? I dont sleep very well, not at all really I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyns It would be poetic I suppose but fast Too fast
cersei	I thought about having him crush your daughters skull
cersei	Shes so beautiful The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, its just not right
tyene	Momma
cersei	Qyburn, hes the cleverest man I know Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella The long goodbye, was that it?
qyburn	The Long Farewell
cersei	Thats the one
cersei	How long does the poison take?
qyburn	Difficult to say Hours, days, it depends on the subjects constitution
cersei	But death is certain?
qyburn	Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain
cersei	Your daughter will die here in this cell You will be here watching when she does You will be here the rest of your days If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices youve made

council room tycho	No, thank you
tycho	My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son From all reports he was a fine young man
cersei	The Iron Bank didnt send you hear to offer condolences
tycho	Condolences and congratulations Youve become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms Thats quite an accomplishment The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law
cersei	The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident
tycho	Indeed But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership
cersei	The Iron Bank wants its gold back
tycho	Your father never minced words either But, yes, your debts are considerable And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts We both know how expensive war can be
cersei	And we both know gold wins wars Your vaults are empty Your late husbands profligacy saw to that
tycho	Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies Youre surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne
cersei	And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner
tycho	We dont make bets We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful
cersei	Thats a fancy way of saying bet The war has already begun Ive drawn first blood I decapitated the Dornish snake My armada owns the Narrow Sea
tycho	Euron Greyjoys armada owns the Narrow Sea
cersei	Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me
tycho	For now Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
cersei	Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think Now, lets talk about the Targaryen girl You want to invest in her? Im guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?
tycho	The slave trade has entered a down turn, its true
cersei	From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
cersei	The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
tycho	Your fathers daughter indeed
cersei	Give me a fortnight Stay in Kings Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full
tyrion	I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack Youre making it difficult You look a lot better brooding than I do You make me feel like Im failing at brooding over failing
jon	Im a prisoner on this island
tyrion	I wouldnt say youre a prisoner on this island Youre free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want
jon	Except to my ship They took my ship
tyrion	I wouldnt say we took your ship
jon	Im not playing word games with you The dead are coming for us all
tyrion	Why dont you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and Ill figure out what to do about your walking dead men
jon	Its hard for me to fathom It really is If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King -
jon	You probably dont believe me
tyrion	I do actually
jon	You didnt before Grumpkins and snarks you called them Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense
tyrion	It was all nonsense Everybody knew it But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows
jon	How do I convince people who dont know me that an enemey they dont believe in is coming to kill them all?
tyrion	Good question
jon	I know its a good question Im looking for an answer
tyrion	Peoples minds arent made for problems that large White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, its almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister
jon	I need to help prepare my people for whats coming I cant help them from here Id like to leave
tyrion	It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily
jon	Everyone told me to learn from my fathers mistakes Dont go south Dont answer a summons from the Mad Kings daughter, a foreign invader And here I am A northern fool
tyrion	Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us And sometimes theres more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didnt Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now While youre our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad Kings daughter She protects people from monsters, just as you do Thats why she came here And shes not about to head north to fight an enemy shes never seen on a word of a man she doesnt know after a single meeting Thats not a reasonable thing to ask
tyrion	So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
jon	What do you mean?
tyrion	Maybe you are a northern fool Im asking if theres something I can do to help you
daenerys	Dragonglass?
tyrion	Yes Volcanic glass, obsidian He says you have a tremendous amount of it here
daenerys	Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies
tyrion	Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally
daenerys	And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
tyrion	Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them Im unsure of the nomenclature
daenerys	And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
tyrion	Id very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it
daenerys	Which wise man said this?
tyrion	I dont remember
daenerys	Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
tyrion	I would never do that to you The reason I believe Jon Snow is because hes here All of his advisors would have told him not to come I would have told him not to come, yet hes here anyway You dont have to believe him Let him mine the Dragonglass If hes wrong its worthless You didnt even know it was here Its nothing to you Give him something by giving him nothing Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand Casterly Rock
daenerys	What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
tyrion	You must allow them their flights of fancy Its dreary in the north
walkways jon	Amazing thing to see
daenerys	I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon Theyre both gone now
daenerys	You lost two brothers as well?
daenerys	People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know
jon	Youve been talking to Tyrion?
daenerys	He is my Hand
jon	He enjoys talking
daenerys	We all enjoy what were good at
jon	I dont
daenerys	You know Im not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne
jon	I never expected that you would
daenerys	And I havent changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne
jon	I havent either
daenerys	I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it Any resources or men you need I will provide for you
jon	Thank you
jon	So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
daenerys	You better get to work, Jon Snow
sansa	How much do we have?
wolkan	4,000 bushels, My Lady
sansa	What does that mean?
yohn	For the current occupants of the castle its enough food for a year, perhaps more
sansa	Whats the longest winter in the past 100 years?
wolkan	Im not entirely certain Ill check Maester Llewyns records He kept a copy of every raven scroll
sansa	Youre telling me we dont have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell
wolkan	No, My Lady, most likely not
sansa	We must prepare for that eventuality Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north If we dont use it by winters end well give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there wont be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them
yohn	Very wise, My Lady
sansa	Maester Wolkan, youll see to it?
sansa	Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
yohn	No, My Lady
sansa	Well, shouldnt they be once the real cold comes?
yohn	They should indeed Pardon me, My Lady
yohn	You there, why isnt there leather on these?
littlefinger	Command suits you The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall
sansa	So they should be
littlefinger	I know Cersei better than anyone here If you turn your back on her -
sansa	You dont know Cersei better than anyone here
littlefinger	I only meant to say -
sansa	That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council
littlefinger	One of two things will happen Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end Or life will win out And what then?
littlefinger	Dont fight in the north or the south Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once Live that way and nothing will surprise you Everything that happens will be something that youve seen before

sansa	Try, please, for me
bran	It means I can see everything Everything thats ever happened to everyone Everything thats happening right now Its all pieces, fragments I need to learn to see better When the long night comes again I need to be ready
sansa	How do you know all of this?
bran	The three-eyed raven taught me
sansa	I thought you were the three-eyed raven

sam	No one
marwyn	Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
sam	I seem to remember you
marwyn	But you treated him anyway?
sam	I did
marwyn	I forbade it because its dangerous and rarely successful Especially on someone of that age You could have infected yourself and others You could have devastated the entire Citadel But you didnt Its a meticulous, difficult procedure Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed But you succeeded How?
sam	I read the books and followed the instructions
marwyn	That man is alive because of you You should be proud
sam	Thank you, Archmaester
marwyn	Come here
marwyn	All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away I need you to make copies of them
marwyn	You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel Youd better get started Be mindful of the paper mites They like flesh as well
daenerys	We need to find Euron Greyjoys fleet and sink it
varys	Your Grace, hes already destroyed a good portion of our fleet To send our remaining ships after him -
daenerys	Im not talking about sending our ships after him
tyrion	But youll have to go yourself Eurons ships could be anywhere or in more than one place Youd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long
daenerys	I wouldnt be alone Id have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal What can anyone do to them?
missandei	They can still do something to you It only takes one arrow
tyrion	Its too great a risk Youre too important
daenerys	What about Casterly Rock?
varys	The Unsullied will be there soon
missandei	And what will they face?
varys	A difficult situation They know were coming
tyrion	Yes Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister She will be ready
tyrion	No one has ever taken the rock
tyrion	The Lannister army is still the army my father built Well trained and well provisioned 10,000 men at least They will see us coming
tyrion	They will be ready
man	Draw! Loose
tyrion	The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable
tyrion	The fight up the walls will be hard Well be at a disadvantage Many men will die
tyrion	Interesting thing about my father He built our house up from near ruin He built our army He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didnt build the sewers That was beneath him So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find Me He was right I was low The company I kept low, women mostly They werent welcome at the Rock Father disapproved of that sort of behavior I couldnt walk them through the front gates I couldnt have them in my chambers So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself
tyrion	It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers
tyrion	No better place for low pursuits Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress
tyrion	As a good friend of mine once said, give me 10 good men and Ill impregnate the bitch
tyrion	And so it begins They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces They will be outnumbered They will have less armor and fewer weapons
tyrion	But as my sisters armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them They will be fighting for you And that is why they will triump
unsullied	There are none left
grey worm	There are supposed to be more than this Many more
grey worm	Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?

fields cut to	HIGHGARDEN
cut to	S QUARTERS
olenna	Its done?
jaime	It is
olenna	And now the rains weep for our whores Did we fight well?
jaime	I suppose as well as can be expected
olenna	It was never our forte Golden roses indeed Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock
jaime	The truth is Casterly Rock isnt worth much anymore Well, it is to me My fond childhood memories wont keep Cersei on the throne
olenna	So youll just let them take it?
jaime	For now They wont be able to hold it Euron Greyjoys navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left Eventually theyll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros
olenna	And you took your army, your real army, and went where they werent?
jaime	As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood There are always lessons in failures
olenna	Yes You must be very wise by now
jaime	My father always said I was a slow learner
olenna	If he was so clever why didnt he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose Ill be able to ask him myself soon enough No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?
olenna	That was Joffreys sword, wasnt it? Not that he ever used it What did he call it?
jaime	Widows Wail
olenna	He really was a cunt, wasnt he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders I never lost a nights sleep over them They were necessary And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did But your sister has done things I wasnt capable of imagining That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination Shes a monster, you do know that?
jaime	To you, sure To others as well But after weve won and theres no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think theyll wring their hands over the way she built it?
olenna	You love her You really do love her You poor fool Shell be the end of you
jaime	Possibly Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?
olenna	What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps youre right If shes driven you this far its gone beyond your control
jaime	Yes, it has
olenna	Shes a disease I regret my role in spreading it You will too
jaime	I think were done here
olenna	How will it happen?
jaime	Cersei had several ideas Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of Kings Landing I talked her out of those
olenna	Will there be pain?
jaime	No I made sure of that
olenna	Thats good
jaime	Halt that wagon! JAIME opens the carriage It is filled with gold bars and coins He picks up a large sack and hands it t
bronn	You just won the biggest prize in the world What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on You can tell me Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
jaime	Ill save my confessions for the High Septon
bronn	There is no more High Septon
jaime	No, there isnt, is there?
bronn	There is still the question of my prize is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold He stops and turns to BRONN
jaime	Thats a lot of money I just gave you
bronn	Its not a castle turns and points to Highgarden
bronn	How about that one? Its available
jaime	You dont want Highgarden
bronn	I beg to differ
jaime	Were at war Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in Besides, think of the upkeep The more you own, the more it weighs you down
bronn	Oh, is that why youre so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting
jaime	Theyre not mine The gold belongs to the Iron Bank We pay our debts
bronn	Right Just not to me
jaime	Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap youre from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you
bronn	Yes, Im sure Queen Cerseis reign will be quiet and peaceful
jaime	Stranger things have happened
bronn	Like what TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback addresses JAIME
randyll	The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord
jaime	The current harvest?
dickon	We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach looks over to BRONN
jaime	Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?
bronn	Im not much for shoveling weight
jaime	No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, Ive heard you guys have a real talent for that
randyll	My Lord
dickon	My Lord RANDYLL, DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road
cut to	REDKEEP COUNCIL ROOM CERSEI an NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion
tycho	I must say, I dont think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely
cersei	Youre too kind, My Lord
tycho	I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment And the current arithmetic is outstanding The gold -
cersei	Is on its way My brother is supervising its transportation himself
tycho	Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed Theyve grown rather fond of your interest payments
cersei	We must devise a way to raise their spirits
tycho	Yes Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture
cersei	My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it
tycho	I see a great deal of potential in that venture I imagine that it would require outside investment?
cersei	It will indeed I need to expand my armies, my navies My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos
tycho	I know them well Theyve helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears
cersei	Thats good to hear I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me
tycho	Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Banks support, as soon as the gold arrives BRANS QUARTERS BRAN is sitting in a wheelchair PETE is sitting next to him unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN Its the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago
littlefinger	This is for you flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN
littlefinger	The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off BRAN reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully
littlefinger	The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have I wasnt there for her when she needed me most But I am here for her now To do what she would have done, to protect her children Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask
bran	Do you know who this belonged to?
littlefinger	No That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings In a way, that dagger made you what you are today Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall I imagine youve seen things most men wouldnt believe hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN BRAN slides the knife into the sheath
littlefinger	To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine -
bran	Chaos is a ladder BRAN is staring a stops speaking The door opens and Meera appears
littlefinger	Im sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark BAELISH stands up to leave
bran	Im not Lord Stark BAELISH bows and walks past Meera and closes the door notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair
meera	Whats that?
bran	Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily
meera	Its a very good idea

meera	I dont want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family And youre safe, safe as anyone can be now You dont need me anymore
bran	No, I dont
meera	Thats all youve got to say?
bran	Thank you
meera	Thank you?
bran	For helping me
meera	My brother died for you Hodor and Summer died for you I almost died for you Bran
bran	Im not really, not anymore I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now begins to cry

missandei	Many things
daenerys	Many things? Jon Snow appears at the bottom of the path
jon	Your Grace looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down
daenerys	Its all right DAENERYS descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking wit They walk along the beach until they reach a cave DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch
jon	I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls He continues walking deeper into the cave
jon	So this is it, all well ever need DAENERYS is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass
jon	There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass
jon	The Children of the Forest made these
daenerys	When?
jon	A very long time ago
daenerys	They were right here standing where were standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters Maybe even before there were men
jon	No DAENERYS stops looking at the walls and turns to look a walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together
jon	They were here together the Children and the First Men
daenerys	Doing what? Fighting each other? JON take by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers
daenerys	They fought together against their common enemy Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together We need to do the same if were going to survive and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King
jon	Because the enemy is real Its always been real
daenerys	And you say you cant defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
jon	No, I dont think I can steps forward closer to JON
daenerys	I will fight for you I will fight for the north when you bend the knee
jon	My people wont accept a southern ruler, not after everything theyve suffered steps even closer to JON until theyre face to face

daenerys	What is it?
tyrion	We took Casterly Rock
daenerys	Thats very good to hear TYRION and VARYS look at each other They arent eager to deliver the bad news
daenerys	Isnt it? The group are all walking along the beach Daenerys is displeased
davos	Youll want to discuss this amongst yourselves Perhaps -
daenerys	You will stay All my allies are gone Theyve been taken from me while Ive been sitting here on this island
tyrion	We still have the largest army
daenerys	Who wont be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach
tyrion	Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland Commit to the blockade of Kings Landing We have a plan Its still the right plan stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion
daenerys	The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach
tyrion	If Ive underestimated our enemies -
daenerys	Our enemies? Your family, you mean Perhaps you dont want to hurt them after all begins looking out to the ocean Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water
daenerys	Enough with the clever plans turns back and looks at TYRION
daenerys	I have three large dragons Im going to fly them to the Red Keep
tyrion	Weve discussed this
daenerys	My enemies are in the Red Keep What kind of a queen am I if Im not willing to risk my life to fight them?

daenerys	What do you think I should do?
jon	I would never presume to -
daenerys	Im at war Im losing begins walking close to JON
daenerys	What do you think I should do looks over the ocean at the dragons flying
jon	I never thought that dragons would exist again No one did The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen Build a world thats different from the shit one theyve always known glances back towards the dragons
jon	But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, youre not different Youre just more of the same DAENERYS looks back out to her dragons flying along the water and PODRICK are sparring kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt
brienne	Dont lunge PODRICK pushes himself back up and picks up his sword PODRICK attacks again Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again

missandei	Ser Davos, Lord Snow
davos	King Snow, isnt it? No? That doesnt sound right King Jon?
jon	It doesnt matter
missandei	Forgive me, but may I ask a question?
jon	Of course
missandei	Your name is Jon Snow, but your fathers name was Ned Stark?
jon	Im a bastard My mother and father werent married
davos	Is the custom different in Naarth?
missandei	We dont have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesnt exist
davos	The sounds liberating
jon	Why did you leave your homeland?
missandei	I was stolen away by slavers
jon	Im sorry
davos	If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?
missandei	She bought me from my master and set me free
davos	That was good of her Of course youre serving her now, arent you?
missandei	I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen Because I believe in her
jon	And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow -
missandei	Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune
jon	You believe that?
missandei	I know it All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her Shes not our queen because shes the daughter of some king we never knew Shes the queen we chose
davos	Youll forgive me if I switch sides notices a single ship sailing into the bay It has a kraken sigil MISSANDEI turns to look

randyll	We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time
jaime	We are stretched a bit thin
randyll	With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility
jaime	Lets give them fair warning first These men fought well at Highgarden RANDYLL is clearly disappointed He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation

jaime	They didnt deserve to die But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl So here we are
dickon	I didnt expect it to smell like that
bronn	Men shit themselves when they die Didnt they teach you that at fancy lad school? JAIME looks over at

jaime	We can hold them off.A dragon can be heard roaring in the distance and DROGON come flying over the Dothraki and over the battlefield commands DROGON to attack
daenerys	Dracarys! DROGON breathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers The men burst into flames and start screaming DICKON looks on in shock A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down attempts to issue orders to the men
jaime	Hold the line! The main force of Dothraki crashes into shielded pikemen Men on both sides are being slaughtered A second wave of Dothraki Screamers ride in They switch from a seated position to standing atop their saddles shooting bow and arrow The Lannister archers fire back and many men are killed DAENERYS and DROGON circle around and billow flames across the battlefield DAENERYS steers DROGON down the Kings Road DROGON spews flames and destroys the carriages along the road Carts are exploding into pieces, barrels are flying through the air is looking at the carnage in astonishment

jaime	Loose! The archers fire their arrows in unison DAENERYS sees the and turns Drogon so the arrows bounce harmlessly off his breast She makes a run on another line of carriages and DROGON burns them in a single breath Men are screaming and catching on fire and BRONN survey the damage
jaime	Qyburns scorpion is over there
bronn	Go get it then
jaime	I cant shoot with one hand holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point BRONN hesitates for a moment He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow draws his sword and rides into battle
jaime	Come on! A Dothraki screamer wielding two swords charges JAIME JAIME is blocking the attacks but is getting overpowered DICKON stabs the screamer through his back JAIME nods at DICKON is making his way to the crossbow A Dothraki screamer sees him and charges reaches behind him and retrieves a small sword He throws the sword at the Dothraki but the screamer parries it draws his primary sword and the two men charge at each other A is about to strike, the screamer leans over and cut s horses leg off causin to fall to the ground s bag of gold hits the ground and splits open The screamer is turning his horse around and is about to attac again abandons the gold and runs into the mayhem trying to lose the mounted rider pushes a flaming Lannister soldier out of the way He pulls a sword out of a dead man and uses it to start fighting Dothraki DROGON flies overhead and spews flames through the air manages to escape the mounted rider and disappear into the fog The screamer dismounts and continues the search on foot The screamer climbs onto a covered wagon to check fo When he pulls the canvas back he see behind the crossbow with a bolt pointed at him fires the bolt and impales the Dothraki screamer pulls a lever and the sides of the wagon drop down revealing the crossbow reloads the weapon and begins making adjustments to line up a shot on DROGON
bronn	Where are you? TYRION walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards He can see Lannisters being slaughtered One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak
guard	Your people cant fight TYRION is watching the mayhem Men are screaming and engulfed in flames Horses and carriages run wild with no driver is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water sees her approaching his position

DROGON spits flames into the Lannister position The men standing there are reduced to standing ash The wind blows them away is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire A bolt sails past DROGON and misses reloads the machine DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow takes his time aiming his shot
bronn	Come on you fucker commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow
daenerys	Dracarys! Before DROGON can send flames, BRONN fires a bolt that strikes DROGON in the wing DROGON begins to pinwheel out of control towards the ground BRONN is smiling He whips the machine around and begins reloading DAENERYS and DROGON are falling from the sky DROGON regains control and begins hovering over the river BRONN realizes he doesnt have time to reload and dives out of the way of the incoming dragonfire DROGON spits flames at the machine and instantly destroys it Flames lick over BRONN but he is uninjured DROGON is forced to land on the edge of the river due to his wound DAENERYS climbs from her mount and rushes to pull the spear from DROGONs wing JAIME is 100 yards from DAENERYS watching her She is all alone JAIME sees a spear sticking out of a dead man spots JAIME across the battlefield
tyrion	Flee, you idiot looks at DAENERYS and readies himself He spurs his horse onward
jaime	Come on, boy Come on! JAIME grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position JAIMEs horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water is watching JAIMEs attempt to kill DAENERYS
jaime	You could have killed me
bronn	What the fuck were you doing back there?
jaime	Ending the war by killing her
bronn	You saw the dragon between you and her looks incredulously at JAIME
bronn	And? JAIME sits up and says nothing t sits up and faces JAIME
bronn	Listen to me, cunt Till I get what Im owed, a dragon doesnt get to kill you You dont get to kill you Only I get to kill you
jaime	That was only one of them She has two more If she decides to use them, to really use them -
bronn	Youre fucked
jaime	Dont you mean were fucked?
bronn	No, I do not Dragons are where our partnership ends Im not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on Kings Landing
jaime	I have to tell Cersei pauses and looks at JAIME
bronn	Best well jump back in that river BRONN stands up and walks away JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle BATTLEGROUND TYRION is walking over an ash covered ground There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to wher and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners addresses the captured soldiers
daenerys	I know what Cersei has told you, that Ive come to destroy your cities The camera pans around the prisoners The men are covered in filth and blood from the battle
daenerys	burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children Thats Cersei Lannister, not me Im not here to murder And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world I offer you a choice Bend the knee and join me Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die A few Lannister men kneel to the ground, while most remain standing DROGON roars and moves closer to the men Almost all the Lannister men quickly kneel while a few still remain standing including RANDYLL and DICKON TARLEY speaks to RANDYLL
daenerys	Step forward, My Lord RANDYLL takes several steps toward and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men
daenerys	You will not kneel?
randyll	I already have a queen
tyrion	My sister, she wasnt your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible
randyll	There are no easy choices in war Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back
daenerys	You will not trade your honor for your life I respect that turns to speak to DAENERYS
tyrion	Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier He would be invaluable at the Wall
randyll	You cannot send me to the Wall You are not my queen DAENERYS turns to look at her Dothraki escort The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL As the men are pulling RANDYLL awa steps forward
dickon	You will have to kill me too pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son
randyll	Step back and shut your mouth
daenerys	Who are you?
randyll	A stupid boy
dickon	Im Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley
tyrion	You are the future of your house This war has already wiped one great house from the world Dont let it happen again Bend the knee looks to RANDYLL RANDYLL nods to his son
dickon	I will not turns to speak to DAENERYS He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear
tyrion	Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a mans head like a few weeks in a dark cell
daenerys	I meant what I said Im not here to put men in chains If that becomes an option many will take it I gave them a choice They made it
tyrion	Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families -
daenerys	Im not beheading anyone pauses and looks over the DROGON DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings
tyrion	Your Grace looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm
daenerys	Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON
daenerys	Dracarys DROGON draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men They are instantly engulfed in flames They both collapse into ash after a few seconds There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood The Lannister men recoil in horror Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield HALLWAY JAIME is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEIs room As he approaches exits the queens chambers
qyburn	My Lord JAIME passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges int s quarters stand and walks over to JAIME
cersei	How many men did we lose?
jaime	We havent done a full counting
cersei	Its armies that win wars We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us We can buy mercenaries
cersei	Theyre not the same as our men but theyll fight if theyre well paid, which they will be
jaime	I just saw the Dothraki fight Theyll beat any mercenary army Theyll beat any army Ive ever seen Killing our men wasnt war for them, it was sport Her dragon burned a thousand wagons Qyburns scorpion fired bolts bigger than you They couldnt stop it And she has three of them This isnt a war we can win
cersei	So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her fathers throne, the father you betrayed and murdered And in her mind shes winning What sort of offer do you think shed make turns and walks away from JAIME
cersei	Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son
jaime	He didnt
cersei	You saw the crossbow, you saw his body walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing
jaime	Im not talking about father Tyrion didnt kill Joffrey He had nothing to do with it
cersei	After all this time it still amazes me -
jaime	It was Olenna She confessed before she died
cersei	And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
jaime	After
cersei	And you believed her?
jaime	If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth looks away, then sits down
cersei	I shouldnt have listened to you She should have died screaming
jaime	Shes dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house And if we dont find a way out of this war well follow them
cersei	So we fight and die or we submit and die I know my choice A soldier should know his

daenerys	Theyre beautiful, arent they?
jon	That wasnt the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are Gorgeous beasts
daenerys	Theyre not beasts to me No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, theyre my children DAENERYS turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance
jon	You werent gone long turns back to JON
daenerys	No
jon	And?
daenerys	And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday JON pauses and doesnt say anything
daenerys	Youre not sure how you feel about that?
jon	No, Im not turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows
daenerys	How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
jon	Thousands
daenerys	We both want to help people We can only help them from a position of strength Sometimes strength is terrible When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people
jon	Ser Davos gets carried away
daenerys	So it was a figure of speech? JON doesnt say anything A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue
guard	This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi The guard steps to the side and JORAH MORMONT stands behind him answers the guard in Dothraki
daenerys	He is my friend kneels before DAENERYS
jorah	Your Grace
daenerys	Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend
jon	I served with your father He was a great man JORAH nods to JON

jorah	I wouldnt be here if I hadnt I return to your service, my queen, if youll have me
daenerys	It would be my honor DAENERYS steps forward and hugs JORAH
cut to	A group of ravens are resting on a tree Several of the ravens eyes wash white They take off and fly over Winterfell They cross frozen fields and over a snowy mountain They arrive at The Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-sea and continue over the Wall The ravens fly many miles over tundra and more mountains The birds crest a hill and thousands of dead men can be seen marching south A group of riders and the Night King are on top of an outcrop watching the dead file past As the ravens approach the Night King peers in their direction and the birds scatter and disperse s eyes are pure white They wash back to their normal color He is sitting in front of the Weirwood Maester Wolkan stands next to him
bran	Ravens We need to send ravens WOLKAN nods his head to BRAN
cut to	CITADEL MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER ARCHMAESTER MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books
maester	I put very little stock in it myself Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes
marwyn	I remember Wolkan A bit timid but a sharp mind
maester	The north has dulled many good maesters wits Im not sure if its the cold, the drink, or the company All the maesters chuckle
maester	A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes SAM stops working and turns around
marwyn	It is a bit much Still we ought to -
sam	Brandon Stark The maesters all turn in their seats to look a
sam	the crippled boy
marwyn	Do you know him?
sam	I let him through the Wall years ago I saw him go beyond the wall
marwyn	And?
sam	Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could Not the Nights Watch, not the Wildlings, no one Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say
maester	Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind
marwyn	I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming steps forward and clears his throat
sam	Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you If you tell people the threat is real theyll believe it If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall theyll do it And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good
marwyn	It could be done And this news could be authentic Its possible Its also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest
maester	That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples
sam	Archmaester, please Its real Ive seen it
marwyn	We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another
sam	Archmaester -
marwyn	That will be all, Tarley SAM turns to collect his work and leave The maesters begin talking to one another
maester	It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest The maesters all chuckle
maester	Dont forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer The maesters continue laughing SAMWELL gets the last of his work and walks out of the door in disgust turns to look at MARWYN
maester	Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
marwyn	Im afraid so
maester	Horrible business
marwyn	I dont have the heart to tell him yet Hes a good lad crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table
marwyn	Right The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked VARYS an are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS
tyrion	All rulers demand that people bend the knee Its why theyre rulers She gave Tarley a choice A man who had taken up arms against her What else could she do?
varys	Not burn him alive alongside his son
tyrion	I am her hand, not her head I cant make her decisions for her
varys	Thats what I used to tell myself about her father I found the traitors but I wasnt the one burning them alive I was only a purveyor of information reaches over to TYRIONs cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it He grimaces as he drinks
varys	Its what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, Im not the one doing it As the pitch of their screams rose higher, Im not the one doing it When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, Im not the one doing it VARYS drinks again and sets the cup down next t picks it up
tyrion	Daenerys is not her father
varys	And she never will be with the right counsel You need to find a way to make her listen looks down at the note in VARYSs hand
tyrion	Who is that for?
varys	Jon Snow
tyrion	Did you read it?
varys	Its a sealed scroll for the King in the North pauses and drinks from his cup of wine
tyrion	Whats it say?
varys	Nothing good DAENERYS and VARYS are seated at the painted table TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen DAVOS an SNOW are standing on the other end of the table is holding a raven scroll and reading it
jon	I thought Arya was dead I thought Bran was dead
daenerys	Im happy for you You dont look happy
jon	Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch If they make it past the wall -
varys	The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years Presumably interrupts VARYS
jon	I need to go home
daenerys	You said you dont have enough men
jon	Well fight with the men we have Unless youll join us
daenerys	And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in
tyrion	Perhaps not Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children What if we prove her wrong?
jon	I dont think shell come see the dead at my invitation begins walking around the table closer to JON
tyrion	So bring the dead to her
daenerys	I thought that was what we are trying to avoid
tyrion	We dont have to bring the whole army Only one soldier
davos	Is that possible?
jon	The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall
tyrion	Bring one of these things down to Kings Landing and show her the truth
varys	Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital
tyrion	The only person she listens to is Jaime He may listen to me
daenerys	And how would you get into Kings Landing Everyone in the room stops and looks a
davos	I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, Im warning you, Im not a fighter TYRION nods his head
daenerys	Well, it will all be for nothing if we dont have one of these dead men
varys	Fair point How do you propose to find one? JON pauses and stares at the ground breaks the silence
jorah	With the queens permission Ill go north and take one DAENERYS turns to look a
jorah	You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you Allow me to serve you
jon	The free folk will help us They know the real north better than anyone
davos	They wont follow Ser Jorah
jon	They wont have to
davos	You cant lead a raid beyond the wall Youre not in the Nights Watch anymore Youre King in the North
jon	Im the only one here whose fought them Im the only one here who knows them
daenerys	I havent given you permission to leave
jon	With respect, Your Grace, I dont need your permission I am a king And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people Now Im asking you to trust in a stranger because its our best chance DAENERYS pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement THE GREAT HALL Northen lords includin GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE and are congregated in the Great Hall ARYA walks into the room and hears a loud discussion The lords are adressing SANSA who is seated at the head table
robett	ing in the North should stay in the north We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have The men agree in unison ROYCE stands up and walks in front of SANSA
yohn	nights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark
sansa	Youre very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king He is doing what he thinks is best The men sit down and everyone in the hall begins talking to one another HALL and ARYA are walking through the hall t s quarters having a discussion
sansa	I warned Jon this would happen He cant leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost
arya	He didnt He trusted you to hold it for him
sansa	Well, hes not making it easy The northern lords are proud The girls arrive at SANSAs quarters is glancing around the room
arya	These are mother and fathers chambers
sansa	And?
arya	Nothing
sansa	Dont do that SANSA turns around to fac
arya	What?
sansa	Say what you mean
arya	You always liked nice things It made you feel better than everyone drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA
sansa	Are you angry with me?
arya	They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened
sansa	I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell
arya	Their opinions are important to you?
sansa	Glover has 500 men Royce has 2,000 Offend them and Jon loses his army
arya	Not if they lose their heads first
sansa	Winterfell didnt just fall into our hands We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together Now, Im sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but thats not the way you get people to work together
arya	And if Jon doesnt come back, youll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want
sansa	How can you even think such a horrible thing?
arya	Youre thinking it right now You dont want to be, but the thought just wont go away and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment
sansa	I have work to do SANSA turns and walks away fro

jaime	Dont talk about our father
tyrion	Listen to me -
jaime	I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again Id cut you in half glances down at the sword in JAIMEs hand
tyrion	It would take you awhile with a sparring sword JAIME shakes his head and says nothing
tyrion	He was going to execute me He knew I was innocent He didnt hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am The little monster sent to punish him Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose -

davos	I wasnt sure Id find you The blacksmith puts the sword down and turns around, revealing GENDRY, the bastard son of Robert Baratheon
davos	I thought you might still be rowing GENDRY chuckles an smiles
davos	I looked in shops, taverns, brothels I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel

sansa	You were there?
arya	I was there standing in the crowd near Baelors statue

missandei	Why did they build it?
jorah	Dragons dont understand the difference between what is theirs and what isnt Land, livestock, children Letting them roam free around a city was a problem
tyrion	I imagine it was a sad joke at the end An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world

bronn	I put yourself at risk Important difference Its your head Queen Cerseis offered a bag of gold for, its not mine Now, thanks to me, shes got two traitors heads coming right through her door She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater If thats not looking after myself, I dont know what is
tyrion	Its good to see you again
bronn	Yeah, you, too
sandor	Anyone touches it, Ill kill you first
bronn	Come on, Pod Lets you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?
sandor	I left this shit city because I didnt want to die in it Am I going to die in this shit city?
tyrion	You might
sandor	And this is all your idea Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it
tyrion	And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through
sandor	Remember me? Yeah, you do Youre even fucking uglier than I am now What did they do to you? Doesnt matter Thats not how it ends for you, brother
cersei	Where is she?
tyrion	Shell be here soon
cersei	Didnt travel with you?
tyrion	No
cersei	Weve been here for some time
daenerys	My apologies
tyrion	We are all facing a unique
euron	Theon! I have your sister
tyrion	I think we ought to begin with larger concerns
euron	Then why are you talking? Youre the smallest concern here
tyrion	Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasnt even good He explained it at the end Never explain It always ruins it
euron	We dont even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth An act of mercy for the parents
jaime	Perhaps you ought to sit down
euron	Why?
cersei	Sit down or leave
tyrion	We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown We have suffered at each others hands We have lost people we love at each others hands If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face
cersei	So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?
tyrion	We all know that will never happen
cersei	Then why are we here?
jon	This isnt about living in harmony Its just about living The same thing is coming for all of us A general you cant negotiate with An army that doesnt leave corpses behind on the battlefield Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city Theyre about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead
cersei	I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement
jon	This is serious I wouldnt be here if it werent
cersei	I dont think its serious at all I think its another bad joke If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, youre asking me for a truce
daenerys	Yes Thats all
cersei	Thats all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt Or while you solidify and expand your position Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men
daenerys	Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with You have my word
cersei	The word of a would-be usurper
tyrion	There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years We have something to show you
jon	We can destroy them by burning them
jon	And we can destroy them with dragonglass If we dont win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world
jon	There is only one war that matters the Great War And it is here
daenerys	I didnt believe it until I saw them I saw them all
jaime	How many?
daenerys	A hundred thousand, at least
euron	Can they swim?
jon	No
euron	Good Im taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands
cersei	What are you talking about?
euron	Ive been around the world Ive seen everything, things you couldnt imagine, and this this is the only thing Ive ever seen that terrifies me
euron	Im going back to my island You should go back to yours When winters over, well be the only ones left alive
cersei	Hes right to be afraid And a coward to run If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule Everything we suffered will have been for nothing Everything we lost will have been for nothing The crown accepts your truce Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy
cersei	In return
daenerys	Just the King
cersei	I would never ask it of you You would never agree to it And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now I ask it only of Ned Starks son I know Ned Starks son
jon	I am true to my word Or I try to be That is why I cannot give you what you ask I cannot serve two queens And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen
cersei	Then there is nothing left to discuss The dead will come north first Enjoy dealing with them We will deal with whatever is left of you
brienne	Ser Jaime
jaime	Its been good to see you I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield
brienne	We both saw what just happened We both saw that thing
jaime	Yes, and Im not looking forward to seeing more of them But Im loyal to the queen and youre loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother
brienne	Oh, fuck loyalty
jaime	Fuck loyalty?
brienne	This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths Talk to the queen
jaime	And tell her what?
davos	I wish you hadnt done that
daenerys	Im grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here If its all for nothing, then he died for nothing
jon	I know
tyrion	Im pleased you bent the knee to our queen
jon	Im not going to swear an oath I cant uphold Talk about my father
tyrion	That is indeed a problem The more immediate problem is that were fucked
davos	Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
tyrion	Only one Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister
daenerys	I didnt come all this way to have my Hand
tyrion	I dont want Cersei to murder me either I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble
jon	I did this I should go
tyrion	Shell definitely murder you I go see my sister
tyrion	You spoke with her?
jaime	At her until she kicked me out She thinks I was an idiot to trust you A lot of people seem to think that, actually
tyrion	Im about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world whos already tried to kill me twice, that I know of Whos an idiot?
jaime	I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another
cersei	I shouldnt be surprised, I suppose Shes your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesnt know her place
tyrion	A foreign whore you cant abduct, beat, or intimidate That must be difficult for you
cersei	So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom youve convinced to bow down before her
tyrion	I didnt know about that
cersei	And now youve got them both working towards the same goal, the goal youve worked towards your entire life
tyrion	Cersei, I didnt know
cersei	the destruction of this family
tyrion	I am the one preventing that from happening Daenerys didnt want to debate and negotiate She didnt want to bring you words She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise I dont want to destroy our family I never have
cersei	You killed our father
tyrion	After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didnt commit, yes, I killed him Hate me for it if you want I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me
cersei	Oh, poor little man Your papa was mean to you Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen No one wouldve touched them if Father-
tyrion	I have never been more sorry about anything
cersei	I will not hear it, not from you
cersei	I will not hear it
tyrion	All right You love your family, and I have destroyed it I will always be a threat So put an end to me
tyrion	If it werent for me, youd have a motherIf it werent for me, youd have a father
tyrion	I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know
cersei	I will not
tyrion	I dont care I loved them You know I did You know it in your heart if theres anything left of it
cersei	It doesnt matter Your love doesnt matter Your feelings dont matter I dont care why you did what you did I only care what it cost us It cost us our future
tyrion	If theres no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?
cersei	Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction
tyrion	Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something
cersei	What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen
tyrion	Mm, not like this
cersei	But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her
tyrion	Yes
cersei	Why?
tyrion	Because I think she will make the world a better place
cersei	You said shed destroy Kings Landing
tyrion	She knows herself She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them
cersei	Thats the difference between you I dont care about checking my worst impulses I dont care about making the world a better place Hang the world
cersei	That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means And when it came at me, I didnt think about the world Not at all As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea Get on a boat, take those who matter
tyrion	Youre pregnant
jon	No one is less happy about this than I am
daenerys	I know I respect what you did Wish you hadnt done it, but I respect it
daenerys	This place was the beginning of the end for my family A dragon is not a slave They were terrifying Extraordinary They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here They wasted away They grew small And we grew small as well We werent extraordinary without them We were just like everyone else
jon	Youre not like everyone else And your family hasnt seen its end Youre still here
daenerys	I cant have children
jon	Who told you that?
daenerys	The witch who murdered my husband
jon	Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
daenerys	You were right from the beginning If I had trusted you, everything would be different
jon	So, what now?
daenerys	I cant forget what I saw north of the Wall And I cant pretend that Cersei wont take back half the country the moment I march north
jon	It appears Tyrions assessment was correct Were fucked
cersei	My armies will not stand down I will not pull them back to the capital I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War The darkness is coming for us all Well face it together And when the Great War is over, perhaps youll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you I expect not Call our banners All of them
littlefinger	Its not easy for ravens to fly in these storms Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier
sansa	No, this is the way he is, the way hes always been He never asked for my opinion Why would he start now?
littlefinger	I cant believe hed surrender the Northern crown without consulting you
sansa	This is his writing, his signature He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen Hes bent the knee
littlefinger	Ive heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful
sansa	What does that have to do with anything?
littlefinger	Jon is young and unmarried Daenerys is young and unmarried
sansa	You think he wants to marry her?
littlefinger	An alliance makes sense Together, theyd be difficult to defeat He was named King
sansa	Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and shed kill anyone who betrayed her family
littlefinger	You are family, too Would Arya really murder her own sister?
sansa	Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
littlefinger	Only by reputation They worship the God of Death, I believe I never trust godly men
sansa	Theyre killers And Arya was one of them What do you think shes after?
littlefinger	Shes your sister
sansa	She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family
littlefinger	Why did she come to Winterfell?
sansa	To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family
littlefinger	Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
sansa	To provide proof of my betrayals To provide justification after she murders me
littlefinger	And after she murders you, what does she become?
lady jon	If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, theyll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight
daenerys	And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell
jorah	Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace You have many enemies in the North Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow Hell see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero The man who killed the conqueror
jon	Its your decision, Your Grace But if were going to be allies in this war, its important for the Northerners to see us as allies If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message
daenerys	Ive not come to conquer the North Im coming to save the North We sail together
theon	Jon
theon	Can I speak with you?
jon	All right
theon	What you did in Kings Landing, what you said You couldve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth
jon	We went down there to make peace And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if were going to fight together
theon	Youve always known what was right Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew Every step you take its always the right step
jon	Its not It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, its not true Ive done plenty of things that I regret
theon	Not compared to me, you havent
jon	No Not compared to you
theon	I always wanted to do the right thing Be the right kind of person But I never knew what that meant It always seemed like theres like there was an impossible choice I had to make Stark or Greyjoy
jon	Our father was more of a father
theon	He was
jon	And you betrayed him Betrayed his memory
theon	I did
jon	But you never lost him Hes a part of you Just like hes a part of me
theon	But the things Ive done
jon	Its not my place to forgive you for all of it But what I can forgive, I do You dont need to choose Youre a Greyjoy and youre a Stark
theon	When I was Ramsays prisoner, Yara tried to save me Shes the only one who tried to save me She needs me now
jon	So, why are you still talking to me?
harrag	Load up Load up, lads Go on Tides coming in
theon	All of us chose to follow Yara We left the Iron Islands for Yara She would never leave one of us behind Were not leaving her behind
harrag	Your sister-
theon	Shes not dead
harrag	Shes dead Even if Euron hasnt cut her throat yet, shes dead
theon	Shes our queen
harrag	Shes your sister
theon	I did I ran from my uncle
harrag	So, why in fucks name should we listen to you? They say the dead cant swim Were going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves
theon	Were done with all that
harrag	Who says we are?
theon	Yara did She made a pledge Were going to find her, and were going to set her free
harrag	Run away, little Theon Its what you do best
man	He needs to shut his mouth
man	Hey
man	Oh, yes
man	Thats more like it
harrag	Stay down or Ill kill you
harrag	I said stay down or Ill kill you
theon	Not for me For Yara
men	Yara
sansa	Have my sister
arya	Are you sure you want to do this?
sansa	Its not what I want Its what honor demands
arya	And what does honor demand?
sansa	That I defend my family from those who would harm us That I defend the North from those who would betray us
arya	All right, then Get on with it
sansa	You stand accused of murder You stand accused of treason How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
arya	My sister
littlefinger	Lady Sansa, forgive me Im a bit confused
sansa	Which charges confuse you? Lets start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall Do you deny it?
littlefinger	I did it to protect you
sansa	You did it to take power in the Vale Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon
littlefinger	Whatever your aunt
sansa	You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon
littlefinger	I know of no such letter
sansa	You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father
littlefinger	I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened None of you knows the truth
bran	You held a knife to his throat
bran	You said, I did warn you not the trust me
arya	You told our mother
littlefinger	Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl Ive protected you
sansa	Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
littlefinger	If we could speak alone, I can explain everything
sansa	Sometimes when Im trying to understand a persons motives, I play a little game I assume the worst Whats the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThats what you do, isnt it? Thats what youve always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister Thats what you did to our mother
littlefinger	Sansa, please
sansa	Im a slow learner, its true But I learn
littlefinger	Give me a chance to defend myself I deserve that
littlefinger	I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie
john royce	I think not
littlefinger	Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy
sansa	And yet, you betrayed her
littlefinger	I loved you More than anyone
sansa	And yet, you betrayed me
sansa	When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me theres no justice in the world, not unless we make it Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish I will never forget them
littlefinger	Sansa! I-
jaime	Our men in Kings Landing will march north in three days time
man	Itll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train
jaime	We dont have a fortnight If the North falls, we fall Three days The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east Well meet at Lord Harroways Town and march together to Winterfell
cersei	Ser Jaime
jaime	Your Grace
cersei	My lords, I need a moment with my brother
men	Your Grace
cersei	What are you doing?
jaime	Preparing the expedition north
cersei	Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?
jaime	You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy
cersei	Ill say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father
jaime	You saw it with your own eyes You saw a dead man trying to kill us
cersei	I saw it burn If dragons cant stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen cant stop them, how will our armies make a difference?
jaime	This isnt about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead
cersei	And I intend to stay amongst the living Let the Stark boy and his new queen-
jaime	I made a promise
cersei	Our child will rule Westeros
jaime	Our child will never be born if the dead come south
cersei	The monsters are real The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, theyre all real So be it Let the monsters kill each other And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us
jaime	And then what?
cersei	And then we rule
jaime	When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins You understand that, dont you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all If the living win, and weve betrayed them, they march south and kill us all
cersei	The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all Most of them will die in the North
jaime	I faced them in the field We cant beat them We cant beat their dragons
cersei	How many dragons did you see at the pit?
jaime	Two
cersei	What happened to the third?
jaime	For all we know, its guarding her fleet
cersei	She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied She came here to show us all her power No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable
jaime	We cant beat the Dothraki We dont have the numbers We dont have the support of the other houses
cersei	No, we have something better We have the Iron Bank You shouldve listened more when Father-
jaime	The Golden Company is not here Theyre in Essos How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
cersei	Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
jaime	You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander
cersei	And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen
jaime	I didnt conspire with him
cersei	You met with him in secret without my consent You planned to promote my enemies interests That is the definition of conspiracy
jaime	I pledged to ride north I intend to honor that pledge
cersei	And that will be treason
jaime	Treason?
cersei	Disobeying your queen
jaime	Doesnt matter what Id call it
cersei	I told you no one walks away from me
jaime	Are you going to order him to kill me? Im the only one you have left Our children are gone
cersei	Theres one more yet to come
jaime	Give the order, then
jaime	I dont believe you
bran	Come in
