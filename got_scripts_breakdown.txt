waymar royce	What d’you expect? They’re savages One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces
will	I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life
waymar royce	How close did you get?
will	Close as any man would
gared	We should head back to the wall
royce	Do the dead frighten you?
gared	Our orders were to track the wildlings We tracked them They won’t trouble us no more
royce	You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse
will	Whatever did it to them could do it to us They even killed the children
royce	It’s a good thing we’re not children You want to run away south, run away Of course, they will behead you as a deserter If I don’t catch you first Get back on your horse I won’t say it again
royce	Your dead men seem to have moved camp
will	They were here
gared	See where they went
royce	What is it?
gared	It’s

ned	And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran Go on
jon	Don’t think too much, Bran
robb	Relax your bow arm JON
robb	Quick, Bran, faster
cassel	Lord Stark My lady A guardsman just rode in from the hills They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch
ned	Get the lads to saddle their horses
catelyn	Do you have to?
ned	He swore an oath, Cat
cassel	The law is law, my lady
ned	Tell Bran he’s coming, too
catelyn	Ned Ten is too young to see such things
ned	He won’t be a boy forever And winter is coming
robb	Lad, go run back and get the rest
will	White Walkers I saw the White Walkers White Walkers The White Walkers, I saw them
will	I know I broke my oath And I know I’m a deserter I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them But I saw what I saw I saw the White Walkers People need to know If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward Tell them I’m sorry
will	Forgive me, lord
ned	In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name
jon	Don’t look away
ned	King of the Andals and the First Men
jon	Father will know if you do
ned	Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die
jon	You did well
ned	You understand why I did it?
bran	Jon said he was a deserter
ned	But do you understand why I had to kill him?
bran	Our way is the old way?
ned	The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword
bran	Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
ned	The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years
bran	So he was lying?
ned	A madman sees what he sees
jon	What is it?
theon	Mountain lion?
ned	There are no mountain lions in these woods
theon	It’s a freak
ned	It’s a direwolf
ned	Tough old beast
robb	There are no direwolves south of the Wall
jon	Now there are five
jon	You want to hold it?
bran	Where will they go? Their mother’s dead
cassel	They don’t belong down here
ned	Better a quick death They won’t last without their mother
theon	Right Give it here
bran	NO
robb	Put away your blade
theon	I take orders from your father, not you
bran	Please, father
ned	I’m sorry, Bran
jon	Lord Stark? There are five pups One for each of the Stark children The direwolf is the sigil of your House They were meant to have them
ned	You will train them yourselves You will feed them yourselves And if they die, you will bury them yourselves
bran	What about you?
jon	I’m not a Stark Get on
robb	What is it?
theon	The runt of the litter That one’s yours, Snow
jaime	As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you You worry too much It’s starting to show
cersei	And you never worry about anything When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock One hundred foot drop into the water And you were never afraid
jaime	There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father We’re Lannisters Lannisters don’t act like fools
cersei	What if Jon Arryn told someone?
jaime	But who would he tell?
cersei	My husband
jaime	If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores Or is it the other way around? And life will go on
cersei	You should be the Hand of the king
jaime	That’s an honor I can do without Their days are too long, their lives are too short
catelyn	All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here
ned	You have five northern children You’re not an outsider
catelyn	I wonder if the old gods agree
ned	It’s your gods with all the rules
catelyn	I am so sorry, my love
ned	Tell me
catelyn	There was a raven from Kings Landing Jon Arryn is dead A fever took him I know he was like a father to you
ned	Your sister The boy
catelyn	They both have their health Gods be good The raven brought more news The king rides for Winterfell With the queen and all the rest of them
ned	He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after
catelyn	You can always say no, Ned
catelyn	We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber I’m told he reads all night
maester luwin	I’m told he drinks all night
catelyn	How much could he possibly drink? A man of his stature
luwin	We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar Perhaps we’ll find out
catelyn	In any case, candles
jon	Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
theon	It’s for the queen, I bet I hear she
robb	I hear the prince is a right royal prick
theon	Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick
robb	Go on, Tommy, shave him good He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair
catelyn	Gods, but they grow fast Brandon
bran	I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people
catelyn	How many times have I told you No climbing
bran	But he’s coming right now! Down our road
catelyn	I want you to promise me No more climbing
bran	I promise
catelyn	D’you know what?
bran	What?
catelyn	You always look at your feet before you lie Run and find your father Tell him the king is close
catelyn	Where’s Arya? Sansa, where’s your sister?
ned	Hey,, hey, hey, hey What are you doing with that on?
arya	Move
ned	Your Grace
robert	You’ve got fat
robert	Cat
catelyn	Your Grace
robert	Nine years Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
ned	Guarding the North for you, Your Grace Winterfell is yours
arya	Where’s the Imp?
sansa	Will you shut up?
robert	Who have we here? You must be Robb My, you’re a pretty one Your name is?
arya	Arya
robert	Ooh Show us your muscles You’ll be a soldier
arya	That’s Jaime Lannister The queen’s twin brother
sansa	Would you please shut up
ned	My queen
catelyn	My queen
robert	Take me to your crypt I want to pay my respects
cersei	We’ve been riding for a month, my love Surely the dead can wait
robert	Ned
arya	Where’s the Imp?
cersei	Where is our brother? Go find the little beast
ned	Tell me about Jon Arryn
robert	One minute he was fine, and then Burned right through him, whatever it was I loved that man
ned	We both did
robert	He never had to teach you much, but me You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls He showed me what was what
ned	Aye
robert	Don’t look at me like that Not his fault I didn’t listen I need you, Ned Down at Kings Landing Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king
ned	I’m not worthy of the honor
robert	I’m not trying to honor you I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave Damn it, Ned, stand up You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing We were meant to rule together If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood Well, it’s not too late I have a son, you have a daughter We’ll join our Houses
tyrion	Mmh It is true what they say about the Northern girls
ros	Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?
tyrion	I did hear something about that
ros	And the queen And her twin brother They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms
tyrion	And the other brother?
ros	The queen has two brothers?
tyrion	There’s the pretty one And there’s the clever one
ros	I hear they call him the Imp
tyrion	I hear he hates that nickname
ros	Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions
tyrion	Clever girl
ros	We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion
tyrion	Have you?
tyrion	The gods gave me one blessing
jaime	Don’t get up
ros	M’lord
tyrion	Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
jaime	You’ve much to teach me, no doubt But our sister craves your attention
tyrion	She has odd cravings, our sister
jaime	A family trait Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown Don’t leave me alone with these people
tyrion	I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early And this is the first of many courses
jaime	I thought you might say that But since we’re short on time, Come on, girls See you at sundown
tyrion	Close the door!Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyanna’s tomb
robert	Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her
ned	She was my sister This is where she belongs
robert	She belonged with me
robert	In my dreams, I kill him every night
ned	It’s done, Your Grace The Targaryens are gone
robert	Not all of them
viserys	Daenerys
viserys	Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio Touch it Come on Feel the fabric Mmmm Isn’t he a gracious host?
daenerys	We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything
viserys	Illyrio is no fool He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne You still slouch Let me see You have a woman’s body now I need you to be perfect today Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?
daenerys	No
viserys	When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today
maid	It’s too hot, my lady
viserys	Where is he?
illyrio	The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality
illyrio	May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen
viserys	Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame Khal Drogo has never been defeated He’s a savage, of course, but he’s one of the finest killers alive And you will be his queen
illyrio	Come forward, my dear
viserys	Where’s he going?
illyrio	The ceremony is over
viserys	But he didn’t say anything Did he like her?
illyrio	Trust me, Your Grace If he didn’t like her, we’d know
illyrio	It won’t be long now Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne The people drink secret toasts to your health They cry out for their true king
viserys	When will they be married?
illyrio	Soon The Dothraki never stay still for long
viserys	Is it true they lie with their horses?
illyrio	I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo
viserys	Do you take me for a fool?
illyrio	I take you for a king Kings lack the caution of common men My apologies if I’ve given offense
viserys	I know how to play a man like Drogo I give him a queen and he gives me an army DAENERYS I don’t want to be his queen I want to go home
viserys	So do I I want us both to go home But they took it from us So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
daenerys	I don’t know
viserys	We go home with an army With Khal Drogo’s army I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took
sansa	Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
catelyn	Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived
sansa	He’s so handsome
sansa	When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
catelyn	Hush now Your father hasn’t even said yes
sansa	Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms
catelyn	He’d have to leave home He’d have to leave me And so would you
sansa	You left your home to come here And I’d be queen someday Please make father say yes
catelyn	Sansa
sansa	Please, please It’s the only thing I ever wanted
benjen	Is he dead yet?
jon	Uncle Benjen
benjen	You got bigger I rode all day Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters Why aren’t you at the feast?
jon	Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst
benjen	Well, you’re always welcome on the wall No bastard was ever refused a seat there
jon	So take me with you when you go back
benjen	Jon
jon	Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will
benjen	The Wall isn’t going anywhere
jon	I’m ready to swear your oath
benjen	You don’t understand what you’d be giving up We have no families None of us will ever father sons
jon	I don’t care about that
benjen	You might, if you knew what it meant I’d better get inside Rescue your father from his guests We’ll talk later
tyrion	Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch
jon	What’re you doing back there?
tyrion	Preparing for a night with your family I’ve always wanted to see the Wall
jon	You’re Tyrion Lannister The queen’s brother?
tyrion	My greatest accomplishment You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?
tyrion	Did I offend you? Sorry You are the bastard, though
jon	Lord Eddard Stark is my father
tyrion	And Lady Stark is not your mother Making you a bastard Let me give you some advice, bastard Never forget what you are The rest of the world will not Wear it like armor Then it can never be used to hurt you
jon	What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
tyrion	All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes
benjen	You at a feast It’s like a bear in a trap
ned	The boy I beheaded Did you know him?
benjen	Of course I did Just a lad But he was tough, Ned A true Ranger
ned	He was talking madness Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends
benjen	The two he was with are still missing
ned	A wildling ambush
benjen	Maybe Direwolves south of the wall Talk of the Walkers My brother might be the next Hand to the king Winter is coming
ned	Winter is coming
robb	Uncle Benjen
benjen	Robb boy How are ye?
robb	I’m good CATELYN Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
cersei	Yes Lovely country
catelyn	I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time
cersei	Hello, little dove But you are a beauty How old are you?
sansa	Thirteen, Your Grace
cersei	You’re tall Still growing?
sansa	I think so, Your Grace
cersei	And have you bled yet?
sansa	No, Your Grace
cersei	And your dress Did you make it?
cersei	Such talent You must make something for me
cersei	I hear we might share a grandchild someday
catelyn	I hear the same
cersei	Your daughter will do well in the capital Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever
ned	Your pardon
jaime	I hear we might be neighbors soon I hope it’s true
ned	Yes, the king has honored me with his offer
jaime	I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept It would be good to have you in the field The competition has become a bit stale
ned	I don’t fight in tournaments
jaime	No? Getting a little old for it?
ned	I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do
jaime	Well said
sansa	Arya
robb	Time for bed
ned	I’m a Northman I belong here with you, not down south in that rat’s nest they call a capital
catelyn	I won’t let him take you
ned	The king takes what he wants That’s why he’s king
catelyn	I’ll say, Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere He belongs to me now
ned	How did he get so fat?
catelyn	He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink
a voice	It’s Maester Luwin, my lord
ned	Send him in
luwin	Pardon, my lord, my lady A rider in the night from your sister
ned	Stay
catelyn	This was sent from the Eyrie What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding
ned	What news?
catelyn	She’s fled the capital She says Jon Arryn was murdered By the Lannisters She says the king is in danger
ned	She’s fresh widowed, Cat She doesn’t know what she’s saying
catelyn	Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?
luwin	If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
catelyn	They murdered the last Hand Now you want Ned to take the job
luwin	The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help He’s the only one he trusts You swore the king an oath, my lord
catelyn	He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars He owes him nothing Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand
luwin	A different time Different king
viserys	When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion
illyrio	If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it
viserys	When?
illyrio	When their omens favor war
viserys	I piss on Dothraki omens I waited 17 years to get my throne back
illyrio	A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair
jorah	A small gift for the new Khaleesi Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms
daenerys	Thank you, ser Are you from my country?
jorah	Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island I served your father for many years Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king
illyrio	Dragons’ eggs, Daenerys From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful
daenerys	Thank you, Magister
daenerys	She’s beautiful Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say thank you’ in Dothraki
jorah	There is no word for thank you’ in Dothraki
viserys	Make him happy
khal drogo	No
daenerys	Do you know the Common Tongue?
khal drogo	No
daenerys	Is no’ the only word that you know?
khal drogo	No
sandor	Rough night, Imp?
tyrion	If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle
sandor	I didn’t pick you for a hunter
tyrion	The greatest in the land My spear never misses
sandor	It’s not hunting if you pay for it
robert	Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
ned	No, but I’m still better than you
robert	I know what I’m putting you through Thank you for saying yes I only ask you because I need you You’re a loyal friend You hear me? A loyal friend The last one I’ve got
ned	I hope I’ll serve you well
robert	You will And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar
bran	Come on, you
cersei	Stop STOP
jaime	Are you completely mad?
cersei	He saw us
jaime	It’s all right It’s all right
cersei	He saw us
jaime	I heard you the first time Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?
bran	Ten
jaime	Ten
jaime	The things I do for love BLACKOUT
jorah	You need to drink, child And eat
daenerys	Isnt there anything else?
jorah	The Dothraki have two things in abundance grass and horses People cant live on grass In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night It murders all other grass The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything Thats the way the world will end Itll get easier
doreah	Khaleesi
irri	Your hands
jorah	Were still not far from Pentos, your Grace Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality Youd be more comfortable there
viserys	I have no interest in hospitality or comfort Ill stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown
jorah	As you wish, your Grace
viserys	Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
jorah	Selling to one Some poachers I caught on my land
viserys	Under my reign, you wont be punished for such nonsense You can rest assured of that -
joffrey	Better-looking bitches than youre used to, Uncle My mothers been looking for you We ride for Kings Landing today
tyrion	Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies
joffrey	What good will my sympathies do them?
tyrion	None But it is expected of you Your absence has already been noted
joffrey	The boy means nothing to me And I cant stand the wailing of women
tyrion	One word and Ill hit you again
joffrey	Im telling mother
tyrion	Go! Tell her But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them Do you understand?
joffrey	You cant.
tyrion	Do you understand?
sandor clegane	The Prince will remember that, little lord
tyrion	I hope so If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him Time for breakfast.
tyrion	Bread And two of those little fish And a mug of dark beer to wash it down And bacon, burnt black
jaime	Little brother
tyrion	Beloved siblings
myrcella	Is Bran going to die?
tyrion	Apparently not
cersei	What do you mean?
tyrion	The Maester says the boy may live
cersei	Its no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain
tyrion	Only the gods know for certain All the rest of us can do is pray The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you
cersei	I still cant believe youre going Its ridiculous even for you
tyrion	Wheres your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Nights Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers
jaime	Tell me youre not thinking of taking the black
tyrion	And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world
cersei	The children dont need to hear your filth Come
jaime	Even if the boy lives, hell be a cripple, a grotesque Give me a good clean death any day
tyrion	Speaking for the grotesques, Id have to disagree Death is so final, whereas life Life is full of possibilities I hope the boy does wake Id be very interested to hear what he has to say
jaime	My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side youre on
tyrion	My dear brother, you wound me You know how much I love my family -
cersei	Please
catelyn	I would have dressed, your Grace
cersei	This is your home Im your guest Handsome one, isnt he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty He was a fighter too Tried to beat the fever that took him Forgive me Its the last thing you need to hear right now
catelyn	I never knew
cersei	It was years ago Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care The boy looked just like him Such a little thing A bird without feathers They came to take his body away and Robert held me I screamed and I battled, but he held me That little bundle They took him away and I never saw him again Never have visited the crypt, never I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you
catelyn	I am grateful
cersei	Perhaps this time shell listen -
jaime	A sword for the wall?
jon	I already have one
jaime	Good man Have you swung it yet?
jon	Of course I have
jaime	At someone, I mean Its a strange thing, the first time you cut a man You realize were nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot Were grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us
jon	Weve guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years
jaime	Is it we already? Have you taken your vows then?
jon	Soon enough
jaime	Give my regards to the Nights Watch Im sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force And if not, Its only for life -
arya	Thank you, Nymeria Septa Mordane says I have to do it again My things werent properly folded , she says Who cares how theyre folded?! Theyre going to get all messed up anyway

jon	So are you I had the blacksmith make it for you special It wont hack a mans head off, but it can poke him full of holes if youre quick enough
arya	I can be quick
jon	Youll have to work at it every day How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
arya	I think so
jon	First lesson Stick them with the pointy end
arya	I know which end to use
jon	Im going to miss you Careful All the best swords have names, you know
arya	Sansa can keep her sewing needles Ive got a needle of my own -
jon	I came to say goodbye to Bran
catelyn	Youve said it
jon	I wish I could be here when you wake up Im going north with Uncle Benjen Im taking the black I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but youll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when youre better Ill know my way around by then Ill be a sworn brother of the Nights Watch We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if youre not afraid
catelyn	I want you to leave
catelyn	17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon You came back a year later with another womans son And now youre leaving again
ned	I have no choice

ned	You should have asked me 20 years ago
robert	There were wars to fight, women to marry We never had the chance to be young
ned	I recall a few chances
robert	There was that one Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in

robert	Thats it She must have been a rare wench to make Lord forget his honor You never told me what she looked like
ned	Nor will I
robert	We were at war None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again Youre too hard on yourself You always have been I swear if I werent your King, youd have hit me already
ned	The worst thing about your coronation Ill never get to hit you again
robert	Trust me, thats not the worst thing There was a rider in the night
ned	Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
robert	A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it
ned	Shes little more than a child
robert	Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding
ned	Tell me were not speaking of this
robert	Oh, its unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family That was unspeakable What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister the woman I loved Ill kill every Targaryen I get my hands on
ned	But you cant get your hands on this one, can you?
robert	This Khal Drogo, its said he has 100,000 men in his horde
ned	Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea They have no ships, Robert
robert	There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him
ned	He will not cross And if by chance he does, well throw him back into the sea
robert	Theres a war coming, Ned I dont know when, I dont know who well be fighting, but its coming -
benjen	Sit Youll be fed Untie them
tyrion	Rapers They were given a choice no doubt Castration or the Wall Most choose the knife Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch You discard your old family and get a whole new one
jon	Why do you read so much?
tyrion	Look at me and tell me what you see
jon	Is this a trick?
tyrion	What you see is a dwarf If Id been born a peasant they mightve left me out in the woods to die Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock Things are expected of me My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years
jon	Until your brother killed that King
tyrion	Yes, until my brother killed him Life is full of these little ironies My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldnt you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone Thats why I read so much And you? Whats your story, bastard?
jon	Ask me nicely and maybe Ill tell you, dwarf
tyrion	A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Nights Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms
jon	The Nights Watch protects the realm from.
tyrion	Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about Youre a smart boy You dont believe that nonsense Everythings better with some wine in the belly -
maester luwin	Its time we reviewed the accounts, my lady Youll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us
catelyn	Talk to Poole about it
maester luwin	Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention.
catelyn	I dont care about appointments
robb	Ill make the appointments Well talk about it first thing in the morning
maester luwin	Very good, my Lord My Lady
robb	When was the last time you left this room?
catelyn	I have to take care of him
robb	Hes not going to die, mother Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed
catelyn	What if hes wrong? Bran needs me
robb	Rickon needs you Hes six He doesnt know whats happening He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying.
catelyn	Close the windows! I cant stand it! Please make them stop
robb	Fire You stay here Ill come back
assassin	Youre not supposed to be here No one is supposed to be here Its a mercy Hes dead already
catelyn	No! -
daenerys	Have you ever seen a dragon?
irri	Dragon gone, Khaleesi
daenerys	Everywhere? Even in the east?
irri	No dragon Brave men kill them It is known
jhiqui	It is known
doreah	A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon
daenerys	The moon?
doreah	He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the suns fire
irri	Moon is no egg Moon is goddess wife of sun It is known
jhiqui	It is known
daenerys	Leave me with her Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
doreah	Men like to talk when theyre happy Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy
daenerys	How old were you?
doreah	I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house
daenerys	Nine?
doreah	I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi First you must learn
daenerys	Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
doreah	Yes
daenerys	Will it take three years?
doreah	No -
benjen	Welcome -
catelyn	What I am about to tell you must remain between us I dont think Bran fell from that tower I think he was thrown
maester luwin	The boy was always sure-footed before
catelyn	Someone tried to kill him twice Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasnt meant to see
theon	Saw what, my lady?
catelyn	I dont know But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown
rodrick cassel	Did you notice the dagger the killer used? Its too fine a weapon for such a man The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone Someone gave it to him
robb	They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If its war they want.
theon	If it comes to that, you know Ill stand behind you
maester luwin	What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war We dont know the truth yet Lord Stark must be told of this
catelyn	I dont trust a raven to carry these words
robb	Ill ride to Kings Landing
catelyn	No There must always be a Stark in Winterfell I will go myself
robb	Mother, you cant
catelyn	I must
rodrick cassel	Ill send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you
catelyn	Too large a party attracts unwanted attention I dont want the Lannisters to know Im coming
rodrick cassel	Let me accompany you at least ingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone
robb	What about Bran?
catelyn	I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month Brans life is in their hands now -
doreah	No, Khaleesi You must look in his eyes always Love comes in at the eyes It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes
daenerys	Finish a man?
doreah	Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia Magisters sold their palaces Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all
daenerys	Well, she sounds like an interesting woman I dont think that Drogo will like it with me on top
doreah	You will make him like it, Khaleesi Men want what theyve never had And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then dont make love like a slave Very good, Khaleesi Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you
daenerys	I dont think that this is the Dothraki way
doreah	If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
daenerys	No No Tonight I would look upon your face -
sansa	Pardon me, Ser
sandor clegane	Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too Look at that face
sansa	Im sorry if I offended you, Ser Why wont he speak to me?
sandor clegane	He hasnt been very talkative these last 20 years Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers
joffrey	He speaks damn well with his sword though Ser Ilyn Payne, the Kings justice The royal executioner What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog Youre scaring my lady I dont like to see you upset The sun is finally shining Come walk with me
sansa	Stay, Lady I probably shouldnt have any more Father only lets us have one cup at feasts
joffrey	My princess can drink as much as she wants Dont worry Youre safe with me

sansa	He the butchers boy
arya	Hes my friend
joffrey	A butchers boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butchers boy Lets see how good you are
mycah	She asked me to, my Lord She asked me to
joffrey	Im your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword
mycah	Its not a sword, my prince Its only a stick
joffrey	And youre not a Knight Only a butchers boy That was my ladys sister you were hitting, do you know that?
arya	Stop it
sansa	Arya, stay out of this
joffrey	I wont hurt him Much Filthy little bitch
sansa	No no, stop it, stop it, both of you Youre spoiling it Youre spoiling everything
joffrey	Ill gut you, you little cunt
sansa	Arya
arya	Nymeria
joffrey	Please dont
sansa	Arya, leave him alone My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you Stay here, Ill go back to the inn and bring help

soldier	Its a direwolf
soldier	Ill check down here
soldier	I think I heard a noise
arya	Go
jory cassel	My lord! My lord! They found her Shes unharmed
ned	Where is she?
jory cassel	Shes been taken directly before the King
ned	Who took her?
jory cassel	The Lannisters found her
ned	Right, get back
jory cassel	The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him
ned	Back! Back to the inn All back! -
arya	Im sorry
ned	Are you hurt?
arya	No
ned	Its all right What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
cersei	How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
robert	Quiet, woman Sorry, Ned I never meant to frighten the girl But we need to get this business done quickly
cersei	Your girl and that butchers boy attacked my son That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off
arya	Thats not true! She just Bit him a little He was hurting Mycah
cersei	Joffrey told us what happened You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him
arya	Thats not what happened
joffrey	Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river
arya	Liar
joffrey	Shut up
robert	Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Wheres your other daughter, Ned?
ned	In bed asleep
cersei	Shes not Sansa, come here, darling
robert	Now, child Tell me what happened Tell it all and tell it true Its a great crime to lie to a King
sansa	I dont know I dont remember Everything happened so fast I didnt see
arya	Liar! Liar liar liar
sansa	Arya
ned	Stop it! Thats enough of that
arya	Liar liar liar
ned	Stop! Arya
cersei	Shes as wild as that animal of hers I want her punished
robert	What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight Its over
cersei	Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life
robert	You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined Ill do the same with my son
ned	Gladly, your Grace
cersei	And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
robert	Id forgot the damned wolf
soldier	We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace
robert	So be it
cersei	We have another wolf
robert	As you will
ned	You cant mean it
robert	A direwolfs no pet Get her a dog Shell be happier for it
sansa	He doesnt mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didnt bite anyone! Shes good
arya	Lady wasnt there! You leave her alone
sansa	Stop them Dont let them do it Please! It wasnt Lady
ned	s this your command your Grace?
cersei	Where is the beast?
soldier	Chained up outside, your Grace
cersei	Ser Ilyn, do me the honor
ned	No Jory Take the girls to their rooms If it must be done, then Ill do it myself
cersei	Is this some trick?
ned	The wolf is of the north She deserves better than a butcher
ned	The butchers boy You rode him down?
landing guard	Welcome, Lord Stark Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council The honor of your presence is requested
ned	Get the girls settled in Ill be back in time for supper And, Jory, you go with them
jory cassel	Yes, my Lord.King
landing guard	If youd like to change into something more appropriate
jaime	Thank the gods youre here, Stark About time we had some stern northern leadership
ned	Glad to see youre protecting the throne
jaime	Sturdy old thing How many kings asses have polished it, I wonder? Whats the line? ing shits and the Hand wipes
ned	Very handsome armor Not a scratch on it
jaime	I know People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss
ned	Youve chosen your opponents wisely then
jaime	I have a knack for it It must be strange for you coming into this room I was standing right here when it happened He was very brave, your brother Your father too They didnt deserve to die like that Nobody deserves to die like that
ned	But you just stood there and watched
jaime	500 men just stood there and watched All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing And later When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned It felt like justice
ned	Is that what you tell yourself at night? Youre a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryens back?
jaime	Tell me If Id stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
ned	You served him well, when serving was safe -
varys	Lord Stark
ned	Lord
varys	I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad We are all praying for Prince Joffreys full recovery
ned	A shame you didnt say a prayer for the butchers son Renly! Youre looking well
renly	And you look tired from the road I told them this meeting could wait another day, but.
littlefinger	But we have a Kingdom to look after Ive hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me
ned	She has, Lord Baelish I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well
littlefinger	All too well I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone
ned	Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with
littlefinger	It wasnt the man that I chose, my Lord It was Catelyn Tully A woman worth fighting for, Im sure youll agree
grand maester pycelle	I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark
ned	Grand Maester
grand maester pycelle	How many years has it been? You were a young man
ned	And you served another King
grand maester pycelle	How forgetful of me This belongs to you, now Should we begin?
ned	Without the King?
renly	Winter may be coming, but Im afraid the same cannot be said for my brother
varys	His Grace has many cares He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load
littlefinger	We are the lords of small matters here
renly	My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Starks appointment as Hand of the King
littlefinger	Mmm, how much?
ned	40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer
grand maester pycelle	Can the treasury bear such expense?
littlefinger	Ill have to borrow it The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold Whats another 80,000?
ned	Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
littlefinger	Im telling you the Crown is six million in debt
ned	How could you let this happen?
littlefinger	The Master of Coin finds the money ing and the Hand spend it
ned	I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm
grand maester pycelle	Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesnt always listen
renly	Counting coppers, he calls it
ned	Ill speak to him tomorrow This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford
littlefinger	As you will But still, wed best make our plans
ned	There will be no plans until I speak to Robert Forgive me, my Lords I had a long ride
varys	You are the Kings Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure -
cersei	Please, its nearly healed
joffrey	Its ugly
cersei	A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf Youre a warrior like your father
joffrey	Im not like him I didnt fight off anything It bit me and all I did was scream And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them
cersei	Thats not true You killed the beast You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor Someday youll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it
joffrey	Do I have to marry her?
cersei	Yes Shes very beautiful and young If you dont like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses And if youd rather fuck painted whores, youll fuck painted whores And if youd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be Do something nice for the Stark girl
joffrey	I dont want to
cersei	No, but you will The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road
joffrey	We allow the northerners too much power They consider themselves our equals
cersei	How would you handle them?
joffrey	Id double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army
cersei	A royal army?
joffrey	Why should every lord command his own men? Its primitive, no better than the hill tribes We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers Instead of a mob of peasants whove never held pikes in their lives
cersei	And if the northerners rebel?
joffrey	Id crush them Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North Uncle Kevan, maybe
cersei	And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
joffrey	For me Im their King
cersei	But youve just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers
joffrey	Im not asking
cersei	The North cannot be held not by an outsider Its too big and too wild When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldnt save you and your royal army A good King knows when to save his strength And when to destroy his enemies
joffrey	So you agree The Starks are enemies?
cersei	Everyone who isnt us is an enemy -
septa mordane	Enough of that, young lady Eat your food
arya	Im practicing
sansa	Practicing for what?
arya	The Prince
septa mordane	Arya, stop
arya	Hes a liar and a coward and he killed my friend
sansa	The Hound killed your friend
arya	The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do
sansa	Youre an idiot
arya	Youre a liar And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive
septa mordane	Enough
ned	Whats happening here?
septa mordane	Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady
ned	Go to your room Well speak later Thats for you, love
ned	The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcellas toys Dont you like it?
sansa	I havent played with dolls since I was eight May I be excused?
septa mordane	Youve barely eaten a thing
ned	Its all right Go on
ned	War was easier than daughters
arya	Go away
ned	Arya, open the door May I come in? Whose sword is that?
arya	Mine
ned	Give it to me I know this makers mark This is Mikkens work Where did you get this? This is no toy Little ladies shouldnt play with swords
arya	I wasnt playing And I dont want to be a lady
ned	Come here Now what do you want with this?
arya	Its called Needle
ned	A blade with a name And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
arya	Stick em with the pointy end
ned	Thats the essence of it
arya	I was trying to learn I asked Mycah to practice with me I asked him It was my fault
ned	No, sweet girl You didnt kill the butchers boy
arya	I hate them! I hate all of them The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa
ned	Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen And asked to call the Prince a liar
arya	So was I! He is a liar
ned	Darling, listen to me Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday She cannot betray him She must take his side even when hes wrong
arya	But how you can let her marry someone like that?
ned	Well Look at me Youre a Stark of Winterfell You know our words
arya	Winter is coming
ned	You were born in the long summer Youve never known anything else But now winter is truly coming And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another Sansa is your sister
arya	I dont hate her Not really
ned	I dont want to frighten you, but I wont lie to you either Weve come to a dangerous place We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves All right? Go on Its yours
arya	I can keep it?
ned	Try not to stab your sister with it If youre going to own a sword, youd better know how to use it -
old nan	Dont listen to it Crows are all liars I know a story about a crow
bran	I hate your stories
old nan	I know a story about a boy who hated stories I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall Those were always your favorites
bran	Those werent my favorites My favorites were the scary ones
old nan	Oh, my sweet summer child What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds
robb	What are you telling him now?
old nan	Only what the little Lord wants to hear
robb	Get your supper I want some time with him One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber
bran	Maybe we do
robb	How do you feel? You still dont remember anything? Ive seen you climb a thousand times In the wind, in the rain A thousand times You never fall
bran	I did though Its true, isnt it what Maester Luwin says about my legs? Id rather be dead
robb	Dont ever say that
bran	Id rather be dead -
rodrick cassel	Fewer eyes back here, my Lady But still too many
catelyn	Its nine years since Ive set foot in the capital And no one knew who I was the last time I came either
rodrick cassel	My Lady
guard	Welcome to Kings Landing, Lady Stark Would you mind following us?
catelyn	I would Weve done nothing wrong
guard	Weve been instructed to escort you into the city
catelyn	Instructed? I dont know whos providing your instructions, but.
guard	Follow me, Lady Stark
littlefinger	Cat! Go on Go upstairs
catelyn	You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a
littlefinger	I meant no disrespect to you of all people
catelyn	How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
littlefinger	No one will come looking for you here Isnt that what like you wanted? Im truly sorry about the locale
catelyn	How did you know I was coming to Kings Landing?
littlefinger	A dear friend told me
varys	Lady Stark
catelyn	Lord
varys	To see you again after so many years is a blessing Your poor hands
catelyn	How did you know I was coming?
varys	Knowledge is my trade, my Lady Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere Even in the north They whisper to me the strangest stories Valyrian steel
catelyn	Do you know whose dagger this is?
varys	I must admit I do not
littlefinger	Well well, this is an historic day Something you dont know that I do Theres only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms Its mine
catelyn	Yours?
littlefinger	At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffreys last nameday I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger
catelyn	To whom?
littlefinger	Tyrion Lannister The Imp -
alliser thorne	If that were a real sword, youd be dead Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you Pyp Do you think Ned Starks bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
alliser thorne	Next
alliser thorne	Next
alliser thorne	Lord Snow, it appears youre the least useless person here Go clean yourselves up Theres only so much I can stomach in a day
tyrion	A charming man
jeor	I dont need him to be charming I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Nights Watch
tyrion	And hows that going, Commander Mormont?
jeor	Slowly A raven came for Ned Starks son
tyrion	Good news or bad?
jeor	Both -
grand maester pycelle	Lord Stark I meant to give you this earlier So forgetful these days A raven from Winterfell this morning
littlefinger	Good news? Perhaps youd like to share it with your wife?
ned	My wife is in Winterfell
littlefinger	Is she?
littlefinger	I thought that shed be safest in here One of several such establishments I own
ned	Youre a funny man A very funny man
catelyn	Ned
littlefinger	The Starks Quick tempers, slow minds -
grenn	You broke my nose, bastard
jon	Its an improvement
grenn	If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long itd take you to hit
pyp	I wonder if theyd find you before the wolves did
grenn	Whatre you looking at, halfman?
tyrion	Im looking at you Youve got an interesting face Very distinctive faces All of you
rast	What do you care about our faces?
tyrion	Its just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in Kings Landing Perhaps Ill write my sister, the Queen, about it
grenn	Well talk later, Lord Snow
jon	Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me No one but you My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same
tyrion	Grenns father left him too Outside a farmhouse when he was three Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese His little sister hadnt eaten in three days He was given a choice his right hand or the Wall Ive been asking the Lord Commander about them Fascinating stories
jon	They hate me because Im better than they are
tyrion	Its a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik I dont imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here Your brother Bran Hes woken up -
littlefinger	The mere suggestion that the Queens brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason
catelyn	We have proof We have the blade
littlefinger	Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boys wolf
catelyn	Petyr has promised to help us find the truth Hes like a little brother to me He would never betray my trust
littlefinger	Ill try to keep you alive, for her sake A fools task, admittedly, but Ive never been able to refuse your wife anything
catelyn	I wont forget this Youre a true friend
littlefinger	Dont tell anyone I have a reputation to maintain -
cersei	How could you be so stupid?
jaime	Calm down
cersei	Hes a child 10 years old What were you thinking?
jaime	I was thinking of us Youre a bit late to start complaining about it now What has the boy told them?
cersei	Nothing Hes said nothing He remembers nothing
jaime	Then what are you raving about?
cersei	What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw.
jaime	Well say he was lying Well say he was dreaming Well say whatever we like I think we can outfox a 10-year-old
cersei	And my husband?
jaime	Ill go to war with him if I have to They can write a ballad about us The War for Cerseis Cunt
cersei	Let me go
jaime	Never
cersei	Let me go
jaime	The boy wont talk And if he does, Ill kill him Him, Ned Stark, the King the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world -
catelyn	I wish I could see the girls
ned	Its too dangerous
catelyn	Just for a moment
ned	Until we know who our enemies are.
catelyn	I know they did it, Ned The Lannisters In my bones, I know it
ned	Littlefingers right I cant do anything without proof
cersei	And if you find the proof?
ned	Then I bring it to Robert And hope hes still the man I once knew You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing
catelyn	My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday
ned	He still loves you
catelyn	Does he?
ned	Off with you -
robert	Its been a long time But I still remember every face You remember your first?
barristan selmy	Of course, your Grace
robert	Who was it?
barristan selmy	A Tyroshi Never learned the name
robert	Howd you do it?
barristan selmy	Lance through the heart
robert	Quick one Lucky for you Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword I knocked him down with the hammer Gods, I was strong then Caved in his breastplate Probably shattered every rib he had Stood over him, hammer in the air Right before I brought it down he shouted, Wait! Wait! They never tell you how they all shit themselves They dont put that part in the songs Stupid boy Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and hed be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl Wine! Lancel Gods, what a stupid name Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
lancel	Its empty, your Grace
robert	What do you mean its empty?
lancel	Theres no more wine
robert	Is that what empty means?! So get more Tell your cousin to get in here Kingslayer! Get in here Surrounded by Lannisters Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry , son of the mighty Tywin Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks So come on Were telling war stories Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
jaime	One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood
barristan selmy	I was there that day You were only a squire, 16 years old
jaime	You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte Best move I ever saw
barristan selmy	A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina
robert	Your outlaw Any last words?
jaime	I cut his head off, so no
robert	What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
jaime	He said the same thing hed been saying for hours Burn them all If thats all, your Grace -
	Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
jorah	The Dothraki dont believe in money Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts
daenerys	From whom?
jorah	If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices pay tribute or fight An easy choice for most Of course, sometimes its not enough Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves hes given He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly Sometimes a Khal decides his riders havent had a good fight in months and need the practice
daenerys	Tell them all to stop
jorah	You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
daenerys	Until I command them otherwise
jorah	Youre learning to talk like a Queen
daenerys	Not a Queen A Khaleesi
viserys	You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms I dont take orders from savages or their sluts Do you hear me?
irri	Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi
daenerys	No
irri	Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect
daenerys	Please please, dont hurt him Tell him I dont want my brother harmed
viserys	Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King
jorah	Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
rakharo	You walk -
benjen	I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time Im leaving this morning
jon	Youre leaving?
benjen	Im the First Ranger My job is out there There have been disturbing reports
jon	What kind of reports?
benjen	The kind I dont want to believe
jon	m ready I wont let you down
benjen	Youre not going Youre no ranger, Jon
jon	But Im better than every.
benjen	Better than no one! Here A man gets what he earns, when he earns it Well speak when I return -
yoren	A bears balls
tyrion	Youre joking?
yoren	And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat When youre a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves
tyrion	And how do a bears balls taste?
yoren	A bit chewy And what about you, my Lord? Whats the strangest thing youve eaten?
tyrion	Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
yoren	But its not all of ems done bad things Some of ems just poor lads looking for steady feed Some of ems high-born lads looking for glory
tyrion	They have a better chance finding feed than glory
benjen	The Nights Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
tyrion	You dont have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny
benjen	I hope weve provided you with some good stories to tell when youre back in Kings Landing But something to think about while youre drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels Half the boys youve seen training will die north of the Wall Might be a wildings axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold They die in pain And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort
tyrion	Do you think Im plump? Listen, Benjen May I call you Benjen?
benjen	Call me what you like
tyrion	Im not sure what Ive done to offend you I have great admiration for the Nights Watch Ive great admiration for you as First Ranger
benjen	You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word but really counts
tyrion	But I dont believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it
benjen	Youre right The wildlings are no different from us A little rougher maybe But theyre made of meat and bone I know how to track them and I know how to kill them Its not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights Youve never been north of the Wall, so dont tell me whats out there
yoren	Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm
benjen	Enjoy the capital, brother
yoren	I always do
tyrion	I think hes starting to like me Going below ?
yoren	Into the tunnel and out the other side Hell be north of the Wall for a month or two
tyrion	So youre heading down to Kings Landing too
yoren	Day after tomorrow I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons
tyrion	Lets share the road I could use some decent company
yoren	I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord
tyrion	Not this time Well be staying at the finest castles and inns No one turns away a Lannister -
irri	Yes, Khaleesi
daenerys	What are you doing?
irri	When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion
jorah	For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle Its a good weapon for a Dothrakan But a man in full plate the arakh wont get through the steel Thats where the broadsword has the advantage Designed for piercing plate
rakharo	Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses
jorah	Armor
rakharo	Armor Armor make a man Vroz?
jorah	Slow
rakharo	Slow
jorah	Its true, but it also keeps a man alive
rakharo	My father taught me how to fight He taught me that speed defeats size
jorah	I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior
rakharo	He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
jorah	He still is A man of great honor And I betrayed him
irri	haleesi wants to eat something different tonight Kill some rabbits
rakharo	There are no rabbits
irri	Find some ducks, she likes ducks
rakharo	Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
irri	Dog then I have seen many dogs
jorah	I dont think she wants to eat dog
irri	haleesi have baby inside her It is true She does not bleed for two moons Her belly start to swell
rakharo	A blessing from the Great Stallion
irri	She does not want to eat horse
jorah	Ill have the boys butcher a goat for supper I need to ride to Qohor
rhakaro	We ride for Vaes Dothrak
jorah	Dont worry Ill catch you The hordes easy to find -
jon	Dont stand so still Its harder to hit a moving target Except for you You move too much I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me
maester aemon	How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
tyrion	Eight no, nine
maester aemon	All of them brief?
tyrion	They say the winter of my birth was three years long,
maester aemon	This summer has lasted nine But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter The Starks are always right eventually winter is coming This one will be long and dark things will come with it
jeor	Weve been capturing wildlings, more every month Theyre fleeing south The ones who flee say theyve seen the White Walkers
tyrion	Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids
jeor	One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off
maester aemon	The Nights Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men There are less than a thousand of us now We cant man the other castles on the Wall We cant properly patrol the wilderness Weve barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed
jeor	Your sister sits by the side of the King Tell her we need help
maester aemon	When winter does come, gods help us all if were not ready -
daenerys	It’s a boy
khal drogo	How do you know?
daenerys	I know -
jon	Im sorry to see you leave, Lannister
tyrion	Its either me or this cold And it doesnt appear to be going anywhere
jon	Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
tyrion	I expect I will Gods know there arent many feather beds between here and Kings Landing
jon	If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him Tell him Id visit if I could
tyrion	Of course
jon	Hell never walk again
tyrion	If youre going to be a cripple, its better to be a rich cripple Take care, Snow
jon	Farewell, My Lord -
syrio forel	You are late, boy Tomorrow you will be here at midday
arya	Who are you?
syrio forel	Your dancing master
syrio forel	Tomorrow you will catch it Now pick it up That is not the way, boy This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it
arya	Its too heavy
syrio forel	It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong Just so One hand is all that is needed Now you are standing all wrong Turn your body side-face So You are skinny That is good The target is smaller Now the grip Let me see The grip must be delicate
arya	What if I drop it?
syrio forel	The steel must be part of your arm Can you drop part of your arm? No Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos He knows these things You must listen to me, boy
arya	Im a girl
syrio forel	Boy, girl You are a sword, that is all That is the grip You are not holding a battle-axe You are holding.
arya	A needle
syrio forel	Ahhh Just so Now we will begin the dance Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning The knights dance, hacking and hammering This is the Bravos dance The water dance It is swift and sudden All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die Now you will try to strike me
old nan	The little Lords been dreaming again
theon	We have visitors
bran	I dont want to see anyone
theon	Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, Id go mad Anyway, you dont have a choice Robbs waiting
bran	I dont want to go
theon	Neither do I But Robbs Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say Hodor! Help Bran down the hall
tyrion	I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit
robb	Any man of the Nights Watch is welcome at Winterfell
tyrion	Any man of the Nights Watch, but not I, eh, boy?
robb	Im not your boy, Lannister Im Lord of Winterfell while my father is away
tyrion	Then you might learn a lords courtesy
tyrion	So its true Hello Bran Do you remember anything about what happened?
maester luwin	He has no memory of that day
tyrion	Curious
robb	Why are you here?
tyrion	Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt
bran	Kneel, Hodor
tyrion	Do you like to ride, Bran?
bran	Yes Well, I mean I did like to
maester luwin	The boy has lost the use of his legs
tyrion	What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride
bran	Im not a cripple
tyrion	Then Im not a dwarf My father will rejoice to hear it I have a gift for you Give that to your saddler Hell provide the rest You must shape the horse to the rider Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boys voice
bran	Will I really be able to ride?
tyrion	You will On horseback you will be as tall as any of them
robb	Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
tyrion	I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things
robb	Youve done my brother a kindness The hospitality of Winterfell is yours
tyrion	Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark Theres a brothel outside your walls There Ill find a bed and both of us can sleep easier
theon	Couldnt resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros
tyrion	Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you Your master doesnt seem to like Lannisters
theon	Hes not my master
tyrion	No, of course not What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didnt she receive me?
theon	She wasnt feeling well
tyrion	Shes not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?
theon	My ladys whereabouts.
tyrion	My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my fathers fleet burn in Lannisport I believe your uncles were responsible?
theon	Must have been a pretty sight
tyrion	Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive Yes, a great victory for your people Shame how it all turned out
theon	We were outnumbered 10 to one
tyrion	A stupid rebellion then I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle Now here you are, your enemys squire
theon	Careful, Imp
tyrion	Ive offended you Forgive me, its been a rough morning Anyway, dont despair Im a constant disappointment to my own father and Ive learned to live with it Your next tumble with Ros is on me Ill try not to wear her out -

jorah	Vaes Dothrak The city of the horselords
viserys	A pile of mud Mud and shit and twigs best these savages can do
daenerys	These are my people now You shouldnt call them savages
viserys	Ill call them what I like, because theyre my people This is my army Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army
daenerys	If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
jorah	The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea They fear any water their horses cant drink
daenerys	But if they did?
jorah	King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different
daenerys	And you know these men?
jorah	I fought beside them once, long ago Now Ned Stark wants my head He drove me from my land
daenerys	You sold slaves
jorah	Aye
daenerys	Why?
jorah	I had no money and an expensive wife
daenerys	And where is she now?
jorah	In another place, with another man -
doreah	Your Grace?
viserys	Yes, my dear?
doreah	They call you the last dragon.
viserys	They do
doreah	You have dragons blood in your veins?
viserys	Its entirely possible
doreah	What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all
viserys	The brave men didnt kill dragons The brave men rode them Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them melted together like so many candles
doreah	I have always wanted to see a dragon There is nothing in the world that I would rather see
viserys	Really? Why dragons?
doreah	They can fly And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and theyre somewhere else Far away And they can kill Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing melted like so many candles Seeing a dragon would make me very happy
viserys	Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy
doreah	I was not locked in I have seen things
viserys	What have you seen?
doreah	Ive seen A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass Ive seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes And Ive seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk So Have you seen one?
viserys	A pirate ship?
doreah	A dragon
viserys	No, the last one died many years before I was born Ill tell you what I have seen their skulls They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and Id recite their names for him When I got them all right, hed give me a sweet The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong Skulls no bigger than dog skulls But as you got closer to the Iron Throne They got bigger and bigger and bigger There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar And Balerion the Dread whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one
doreah	What happened to the skulls?
viserys	I dont know The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect Scattered to the wind
doreah	Thats very sad
viserys	Yes, it is What did I buy you for? To make me sad?
doreah	No, your Grace To teach your sister
viserys	To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot Go on then Get on with it -
septa mordane	Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince.
sansa	What if I have a girl?
septa mordane	Gods be good, youll have boys and girls and plenty of them
sansa	What if I only have girls?
septa mordane	I wouldnt worry about that
sansa	Jeyne Pooles mother had five children, all of them girls
septa mordane	Yes, but its highly unlikely
sansa	But what if?
septa mordane	If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffreys little brother
sansa	And everyone would hate me
septa mordane	Nobody could ever hate you
sansa	Joffrey does
septa mordane	Nonsense Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? Ive told you a hundred times A direwolf is not.
sansa	Please shut up about it
septa mordane	Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
sansa	Aegon the Conqueror
septa mordane	And who built the Red Keep?
sansa	Maegor the Cruel
septa mordane	And how many years did it take to build.
sansa	My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, werent they?
septa mordane	They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes
sansa	The Mad King
septa mordane	Commonly known as the Mad King
sansa	Why were they killed?
septa mordane	You should speak to your father about these matters
sansa	I dont want to speak to my father, ever
septa mordane	You will find it in your heart to forgive your father
sansa	No, I wont -
janos slynt	Its the Hands tournament thats causing all this trouble, my Lords
ned	ings tournament I assure you the Hand wants no part of it
janos slynt	Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters
varys	Dreadful
renly	If you cant keep the Kings peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can
janos slynt	I need more men
ned	Youll get 50 Lord Baelish will see it paid for
littlefinger	I will?
ned	You found money for a champions purse, you can find money to keep the peace Ill also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left
janos slynt	Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser They will be put to good use
ned	The sooner this is over, the better
varys	The realm prospers from such events, my Lord They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes
littlefinger	And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged
ned	Im sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket Now If theres nothing else, my Lords?
grand maester pycelle	This heat On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows Until tomorrow my Lord
ned	Ive been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn
grand maester pycelle	Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him His sickness struck him very hard and very fast I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed Lord Jon often came to me for counsel
ned	Why?
grand maester pycelle	I have been Grand Maester for many years Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since.
ned	What did Jon want the night before he died?
grand maester pycelle	He came inquiring after a book
ned	A book? What book?
grand maester pycelle	I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord A ponderous tome
ned	Id like to read it
grand maester pycelle	The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children
ned	Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegons landing, at the last hearth Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt
grand maester pycelle	As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read
ned	Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
grand maester pycelle	He did not, my Lord And I did not presume to ask
ned	Jons death.
grand maester pycelle	Such a tragedy
ned	Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
grand maester pycelle	Nothing of import, my Lord There was one phrase he kept repeating The seed is strong, I think it was
ned	The seed is strong ? What does that mean?
grand maester pycelle	The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark For all the weight theyre given, last words are usually as significant as first words
ned	And youre quite certain he died of a natural illness?
grand maester pycelle	What else could it be?
ned	Poison
grand maester pycelle	A disturbing thought I dont think it likely The Hand was loved by all What sort of man would dare.
ned	Ive heard it said that poison is a womans weapon
grand maester pycelle	Yes Women, cravens and eunuchs Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?
ned	Everybody knows that
grand maester pycelle	Yes, yes, of course How that sort of person found himself on the Kings Council, I will never know
ned	Ive taken enough of your time
grand maester pycelle	No trouble at all, my Lord Its a great honor.
ned	Thank you Ill find my own way out -
arya	Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours
ned	Its a hard fall down these steps
arya	Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better Tomorrow Im going to be chasing cats
ned	Cats? Syrio says
arya	He says every swordsman should study cats Theyre quiet as shadows and as light as feathers You have to be quick to catch them
ned	Hes right about that
arya	Now that Brans awake will he come live with us?
ned	He needs to get his strength back first
arya	He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard He cant be one now, can he?
ned	No But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the Kings Council Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder
arya	Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
ned	You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords
arya	No Thats not me -
sam	Hello Ser Alliser said Im to be your new watch partner I should warn you, I dont see all that well
jon	Come stand by the fire Its warmer
sam	No, thats all right Im fine
jon	Youre not Youre freezing
sam	I dont like high places
jon	You cant fight You cant see Youre afraid of heights and almost everything else probably What are you doing here, Sam?
sam	On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me Youre almost a man now, he said, but youre not worthy of my land and title Tomorrow, youre going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north If you do not, he said, then well have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and youll be thrown from your saddle to die Or so Ill tell your mother Nothing would please me more Ser Allisers going to make me fight again tomorrow, isnt he?
jon	Yes, he is
sam	Im not going to get any better, you know?
jon	Well You cant get any worse -
littlefinger	I hear youre reading a boring book
ned	Pycelle talks too much
littlefinger	He never stops Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising Until recently, he was only a squire Jon Arryns squire He was knighted almost immediately after his masters untimely death
ned	Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
littlefinger	I promised Cat that Id help you
ned	Where is Ser Hugh? Ill speak to him
littlefinger	A singularly bad idea Do you see that boy there? One of Varyss little birds The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings Now look there That one belongs to the Queen And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
ned	Varys or the Queen?
littlefinger	No Shes one of mine Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
ned	Yes
littlefinger	The wiser answer was no, my Lord Get a message to this paragon of yours Discreetly Send him to question Ser Hugh After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel
ned	Why?
littlefinger	I have my observers, as I said, and its possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death
ned	Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you
littlefinger	Distrusting me was the wisest thing youve done since you climbed off your horse -
jory cassel	Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh
hugh of the vale	As you can see, Im busy
jory cassel	Im here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king Im the captain of his guard
hugh of the vale	Im sorry I didnt catch your name, Ser.
jory cassel	No ser Im not a knight
hugh of the vale	I see Well, it just so happens that I am -
jory cassel	He said hed be glad to talk to the Hand himself Hes a knight, you see
ned	A knight They strut around like roosters down here Even the ones whove never seen an arrow coming their way
jory cassel	You shouldnt be out here, my Lord Theres no telling who has eyes where
ned	Let them look
tobho mott	The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage
ned	What did Lord Arryn want?
tobho mott	He always came to see the boy
ned	Id like to see him as well
tobho mott	As you wish, my Lord Gendry! Here he is Strong for his age He works hard Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad
ned	This is fine work
gendry	Its not for sale
tobho mott	Boy, this is the Kings Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet.
gendry	I made it for me
tobho mott	Forgive him, my Lord
ned	Theres nothing to forgive When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
gendry	He just asked me questions is all, my Lord
ned	What kind of questions?
gendry	About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here But then he started asking me about my mother
ned	Your mother?
gendry	Who she was, what she looked like
ned	What did you tell him?
gendry	She died when I was little She had yellow hair Shed sing to me sometimes

jory cassel	Forgive me, my Lord.
jaime	Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
jory cassel	Weve met before, you know
jaime	Have we? Strange, Ive forgotten
jory cassel	The siege of Pyke We fought side by side one afternoon
jaime	Thats where you got your scar?
jory cassel	Aye One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye
jaime	Vicious sons of whores
jory cassel	They like their bloodshed
jaime	They stopped liking it at the end That was a proper battle Dyou remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
jory cassel	With his burning sword? Ill remember that till the day I die
jaime	I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop
jory cassel	Theon? Hes a good lad
jaime	I doubt it
robert	Ill bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it Come here
jory cassel	Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark
jaime	I dont serve Lord Stark -
grenn	Where have you been?
jon	Watch duty With Sam
pyp	Prince Porkchop Where is he?
jon	He wasnt hungry
pyp	Impossible
jon	Thats enough Sams no different from the rest of us There was no place for him in the world, so hes come here Were not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore Never again, no matter what Thorne says Hes our brother now and were going to protect him
rast	You are in love, Lord Snow You girls can do as you please But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, Im gonna slice me off a side of bacon.All of the new recruits are sleeping Jon, Ghost , Pyp and Grenn ambush and gag Rast as he sleeps Jon threatens him
jon	No one touches Sam
alliser thorne	What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there
grenn	Hit me Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield I yield
alliser thorne	You think this is funny, do you? When youre out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy? -
viserys	You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head
doreah	Forgive me, Khaleesi I did as you asked
daenerys	Hush now Its all right , take her and leave us
irri	Yes, Khaleesi
daenerys	Why did you hit her?
viserys	How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me
daenerys	I wasnt commanding you I just wanted to invite you to supper
viserys	Whats this?
daenerys	Its a gift I had it made for you
viserys	Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
daenerys	Please
viserys	This stinks of manure All of it
daenerys	Stop stop it
viserys	You would turn me into one of them, wouldnt you? Next youll want to braid my hair
daenerys	Youve no right to a braid Youve won no victories yet
viserys	You do not talk back to me
viserys	You are a horselords slut And now youve woken the dragon.
daenerys	I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands -
sam	I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Moles Town
jon	I wouldnt doubt it
sam	Dont you think its a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
jon	Sally on the side?
sam	Its silly, isnt it? What, we cant defend the Wall unless were celibate? Its absurd
jon	I didnt think youd be so upset about it
sam	Why not? Because Im fat? But I like girls just as much as you do They might not like me as much Ive never been with one Youve probably had hundreds
jon	As a matter of fact, Im the same as you
sam	I find that hard to believe
jon	I came very close once I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but.
sam	You didnt know where to put it?
jon	I know where to put it
sam	Was she Old and ugly?
jon	Young and gorgeous A whore named Ros
sam	What color hair?
jon	Red
sam	I like red hair And her Her.
jon	You dont want to know
sam	That good?
jon	Better
sam	Oh no So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect.
jon	Whats my name?
sam	?
jon	And why is my surname Snow?
sam	Because Youre a bastard from the north
jon	I never met my mother My father wouldnt even tell me her name I dont know if shes living or dead I dont know if shes a noblewoman or a fishermans wife Or a whore So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes But I couldnt do it Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? Its not a good life for a child
sam	So You didnt know where to put it?
alliser thorne	Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys
sam	It is a bit nippy
alliser thorne	A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors Its still summer Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldnt get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
jon	I build my own fires
alliser thorne	Thats admirable I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter It was supposed to be a two-week mission We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch So we went out to look for some of his men Capture them, gather some knowledge The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men Harder than youll ever be They know their country better than we do They knew there was a storm coming in So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass And we got caught in the open Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost And all in darkness You dont know cold Neither of you do The horses died first We didnt have enough to feed them, to keep them warm Eating the horses was easy But later when we started to fall That wasnt easy We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldnt we? Soft, fat boys like you Wed have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup Soon well have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Nights Watch, but youd be fools to believe it Youre boys still And come the winter you will die Like flies -
daenerys	I hit him I hit the dragon
jorah	Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake
daenerys	He is still the true King
jorah	The truth now do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?
daenerys	No But the common people are waiting for him Illyrio said theyre sewing dragon banners and praying for his return
jorah	The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends They dont care what games the high Lords play
daenerys	What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?
jorah	Home
daenerys	I pray for home too My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms He couldnt lead an army even if my husband gave him one Hell never take us home -
littlefinger	Lovers quarrel?
sansa	Im sorry Do I ?
septa mordane	Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish Hes known.
littlefinger	An old friend of the family Ive known your mother a long long time
arya	Why do they call you Littlefinger?
sansa	Arya
septa mordane	Dont be rude
littlefinger	No, its quite all right When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, its an exceedingly clever nickname
robert	Ive been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself
sansa	Gods, who is that?
littlefinger	Ser Gregor Clegane They call him the Mountain The Hounds older brother
sansa	And his opponent?
littlefinger	Ser Hugh of the Vale He was Jon Arryns squire Look how far hes come
robert	Yes, yes Enough of the bloody pomp Have at it
littlefinger	Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire Gregors toy, a wooden knight Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted There arent very many people who know that story
sansa	I wont tell anyone I promise
littlefinger	No, please dont If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, Im afraid all the knights in Kings Landing would not be able to save you -
jory cassel	My Lord, Her Grace the Queen
ned	Your Grace
cersei	Youre missing your tournament
ned	Putting my name on it doesnt make it mine
cersei	I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned How is Sansa?
ned	She likes it here
cersei	The only Stark who does Favors her mother, not much of the north in her
ned	What are you doing here?
cersei	I might ask the same of you What is it you hope to accomplish?
ned	ing called on me to serve him and the realm, and thats what Ill do until he tells me otherwise
cersei	You cant change him You cant help him Hell do what he wants, which is all hes ever done Youll try your best to pick up the pieces
ned	If thats my job, then so be it
cersei	Youre just a soldier, arent you? You take your orders and you carry on I suppose it makes sense Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow
ned	I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace
cersei	As was I -

barristan selmy	Life is strange Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident
ned	Im glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan as is my wife I dont think the widows life would suit her
barristan selmy	Youre too modest Ive seen you cut down a dozen great knights
ned	My father once told me you were the best hed ever seen I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat
barristan selmy	He was a fine man, your father What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime
ned	And that lad He was a squire until a few months ago How could he afford a new suit of armor?
barristan selmy	Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today
ned	Yes That will never happen
barristan selmy	Robert tends to do what he wants
ned	If the King got what he wanted all the time, wed still be fighting a damned rebellion
lancel	Its made too small, Your Grace It wont go
robert	Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains He cant even put a mans armor on him properly
ned	Youre too fat for your armor

ned	Youre torturing the poor boy
robert	You heard the Hand ings too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now

robert	All right, all right But you watch me out there I still know how to point a lance
ned	You have no business jousting Leave that for the young men
robert	Why? Because Im king? Piss on that I want to hit somebody

ned	Your squire A Lannister boy?
robert	Hmm A bloody idiot But Cersei insisted I have Jon Arryn to thank for her Cersei Lannister will make a good match , he told me Youll need her father on your side I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted Enough of this! Lets go watch em ride At least I can smell someone elses blood
ned	Robert?
robert	What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits! -

renly	Or you could even buy a friend
sansa	Hes going to die
ned	Ser Loras rides well
renly	Such a shame, Littlefinger It would have been so nice for you to have a friend
littlefinger	And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?

catelyn	I did often and loudly
tyrion	Very wise Theyll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place Words probably gotten to my father by now Hell be offering a handsome reward Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts Would you be so good as to untie me?
catelyn	And why would I do that?
tyrion	Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots Unless a Shadowcat ate me first
catelyn	Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns
tyrion	Ah the Eastern Road Were going to The Vale Youre taking me to your sisters to answer for my imagined crimes Tell me, Lady Stark When was the last time you saw your sister?
catelyn	Five years ago
tyrion	Shes changed She was always a bit touched, but now you might as well kill me here
catelyn	I am not a murderer, Lannister
tyrion	Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your sons life
catelyn	The dagger found
tyrion	What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?

maester luwin	Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family

maester luwin	Hmm If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback
bran	Really?
maester luwin	Dothraki boys learn when theyre four years old Why shouldnt you? -
theon	Shh Keep it down Youre not supposed to be inside the castle walls
ros	I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here
theon	Important enough for the likes of you
ros	Youre not the only nobleman in my life, you know
theon	Who? the Imp? Id call him half a nobleman
ros	Jealous?
theon	Why should I be jealous?
theon	Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night Whats a dwarf like down below? Ive always wondered
ros	Might surprise you
theon	Hmm?
ros	Hes good with his fingers too And his tongue
theon	Generous tipper I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister
ros	You are jealous
theon	Im a Greyjoy Weve been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years Theres not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters
ros	And what about the Starks?
theon	I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old
ros	A ward”, that’s a nice word for it Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again
theon	My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore
ros	You’re a very serious boy
theon	I’m not a boy
ros	Oh, yes you are A serious boy, with a serious cock
theon	I don’t want to pay for it
ros	Then get yourself a wife -
arya	Come on Im not gonna hurt you
varys	How is your son, my Lord?
ned	Hell never walk again
varys	But his mind is sound?
ned	So they say
varys	A blessing then I suffered an early mutilation myself Some doors close forever others open in the most unexpected places May I?
varys	If the wrong ears heard what Im about to tell you, off comes my head And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders But there are things you must know You are the Kings Hand and the King is a fool your friend, I know, but a fool and doomed unless you save him
ned	Ive been in the capital a month Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
varys	I didnt trust you
ned	So why do you trust me now?
varys	The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely There are few men of honor in the capital You are one of them I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem
ned	What sort of doom does the King face?
varys	The same sort as Jon Arryn The tears of Lys, they call it A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water It leaves no trace
ned	Who gave it to him?
varys	Some dear friend, no doubt But which one? There were many Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man There was one boy all he was he owed to Jon Arryn
ned	The squire, Ser Hugh?
varys	Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely
ned	If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?
varys	Someone who could afford it
ned	Jon was a man of peace He was Hand for 17 years 17 good years Why kill him?
varys	He started asking questions -
varys	Hes found one bastard already He has the book The rest will come
illyrio mopatis	And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
varys	The gods alone know The fools tried to kill his son Whats worse, they botched it The wolf and the lion will be at each others throats We will be at war soon, my friend
illyrio mopatis	What good is war now? Were not ready If one Hand can die, why not a second?
varys	This Hand is not the other
illyrio mopatis	We need time Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born You know how these savages are
varys	Delay, you say Move fast, I reply This is no longer a game for two players
illyrio mopatis	It never was -
varys	The first to arrive and the last to leave I admire your industry
littlefinger	You do move quietly
varys	We all have our qualities
littlefinger	You look a bit lonely today You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening First boy is on the house
varys	I think youre mistaking business with pleasure
littlefinger	Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations
varys	Oh, Im sure Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear
littlefinger	Im a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important
varys	Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
littlefinger	All desires are valid to a man with a full purse
varys	And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination The logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot
littlefinger	Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the Kings laws
varys	Strictly speaking
littlefinger	Tell me Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? Ive often wondered
varys	Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close But enough about me How have you been since we last saw each other?
littlefinger	Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
varys	Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King
littlefinger	Saw me with your own eyes?
varys	Eyes I own
littlefinger	Council business We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark
varys	Everyones well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Starks wife If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boys life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion To think A simple word to the Queen.
littlefinger	One shudders at the thought
varys	Oh
littlefinger	But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me
varys	Have you?
littlefinger	Yes Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers
varys	Was that you under the bed?
littlefinger	And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea Youre from there yourself, after all Were friends, arent we, Lord ? Id like to think we are So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friends sympathies To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm
varys	Oh, please
littlefinger	To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King -
renly	What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, youd best hurry up My brother is coming
littlefinger	To a small council meeting?
varys	Disturbing news from far away Havent you heard? -
guard	Off with you No begging
arya	Im not a beggar I live here
guard	Dyou want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
arya	I want to see my father

ned	You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop
arya	They said they were going to kill you
ned	Who did?
arya	I didnt see them, but I think one was fat
ned	Oh, Arya
arya	Im not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage something about the savage
ned	Where did you hear this?
arya	In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls
ned	What were you doing in the dungeons?
arya	Chasing a cat
jory cassel	Pardon, my Lord Theres a Nights Watchman here begging a word He says its urgent
ned	Your name, friend?

ned	Ah, well find recruits for you

jory cassel	Come along, my Lady You heard your father

vardis egen	Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
catelyn	There was no time to send word
vardis egen	May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?
catelyn	Thats why there was no time He is my prisoner
vardis egen	He doesnt look like a prisoner
catelyn	My sister will decide what he looks like
vardis egen	Yes, my Lady She will at that
tyrion	The Eyrie They say its impregnable
bronn	Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes Ill impregnate the bitch
tyrion	I like you -
steward	Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber A meeting has been called
ned	I need to see the King first alone
steward	ing is at the small council meeting, my Lord He has summoned you
ned	Is it about my wife?
steward	No, my Lord I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen
robert	The whore is pregnant
ned	Youre speaking of murdering a child
robert	I warned you this would happen Back in the North, I warned you, but you didnt care to hear Well, hear it now I want em dead, mother and child both And that fool, Viserys as well Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead
ned	You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this
robert	Honor?! Ive got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think its honor thats keeping the peace? Its fear! Fear and blood
ned	Then were no better than the Mad King
robert	Careful, Ned Careful now
ned	You want to assassinate a girl Because the Spider heard a rumor?
varys	No rumor, my Lord The princess is with child
ned	Based on whose information?
varys	Ser Jorah Mormont He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens
ned	Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
littlefinger	Jorah Mormonts a slaver, not a traitor Small difference, I know, to an honorable man
ned	He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land We commit murder on the word of this man?
robert	And if hes right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army What then?
ned	The Narrow Sea still lies between us Ill fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water
robert	Do nothing? Thats your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? Youre my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool
varys	I understand your misgivings, my Lord Truly, I do It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed
grand maester pycelle	I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
renly	We should have had them both killed years ago
littlefinger	When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with Cut her throat Be done with it
ned	I followed you into war twice, without doubts, without second thoughts But I will not follow you now The Robert I grew up with didnt tremble at the shadow of an unborn child
robert	She dies
ned	I will have no part in it
robert	Youre the Kings Hand, Lord Stark Youll do as I command or Ill find me a Hand who will
ned	And good luck to him I thought you were a better man
robert	Out! Out, damn you! Im done with you Go! Run back to Winterfell! Ill have your head on a spike! Ill put it there myself, you fool! You think youre too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war! -
ned	Ill go ahead with my daughters Get them ready Do it yourself Dont ask anyone for help
jory cassel	Right away, my Lord Lord Baelish is here for you
littlefinger	His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave The word treason was mentioned
ned	What can I do for you?
littlefinger	When do you return to Winterfell?
ned	Why? What do you care?
littlefinger	If youre still here come nightfall, Ill take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill If that sort of thing still interests you
ned	I dont have the time
littlefinger	It wont take more than an hour But as you please
ned	Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls chambers Who are your best two swords?
jory cassel	Heward and Wyl
ned	Find them and meet me at the stables -
lysa arryn	You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing You remember her, dont you? Isnt he beautiful? And strong too Jon knew it His last words were, the seed is strong He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale
catelyn	Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t
lysa arryn	To stay away from them! Not to bring one here
robin arryn	Mommy? Is that the bad man?
lysa arryn	It is
robin arryn	Hes little
lysa arryn	Hes Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister He killed your father He murdered the Hand of the King
tyrion	Oh? Did I kill him too? Ive been a very busy man
lysa arryn	You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale Every one of the loved Jon Arryn Every one of them would die for me
tyrion	If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do
robin arryn	You cant hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him
lysa arryn	Shh Shh Shh, my sweet boy Hes just trying to frighten us Lannisters are all liars No one will hurt my baby
robin arryn	Mommy I want to see the bad man fly
lysa arryn	Perhaps you will, my little love
catelyn	This man is my prisoner I will not have him harmed
lysa arryn	Ser Vardis, my sisters guest is weary Take him down below so he can rest Introduce him t
mord	You go sleep, dwarf man Sleep good, little dwarf man! -
loras	Lord Starks lucky he still has a head
renly	Robert will rant for a few days, but he wont do anything He adores the man
loras	Youre jealous
renly	Are you sure this wont hurt?
loras	Only if I slip
renly	And you prefer me like this?
loras	Mhmm
renly	If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy
loras	I want you
renly	My brother thinks that anyone who hasnt been to war isnt a man He treats me as if Im a spoiled child Oh, and youre not? , the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
loras	Hold still
renly	All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how Im not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood
loras	You did vomit when that boys eye was knocked out in the mêlée
renly	His eye was dangling out of the damn socket
loras	He shouldnt have entered the mêlée if he didnt know how to fight
renly	Easy for you to say Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman
loras	Its not a gift No one gave it to me Im good because I work at it every day of my life since I could hold a stick
renly	I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you
loras	Yes well, I guess well never know
renly	Everywhere?
loras	Everywhere So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
renly	It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is Roberts rather tasteless about it Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches
loras	Its a shame he cant muster the same enthusiasm for his wife
renly	He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money
loras	I have an outrageous amount of money
renly	Not as much as the Lannisters
loras	But a lot more than you
renly	Roberts threatening to take me hunting with him Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day All so he can stick his spear into somethings flesh! Oh but Robert loves his killing And hes the King
loras	Hmm How did that ever happen?
renly	Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it
loras	Do you know who should be King?
renly	Be serious
loras	I am My father could be your bank Ive never fought in a war before, but Id fight for you
renly	Im fourth in line
loras	And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster Tommen is eight
renly	Stannis?
loras	Stannis has the personality of a lobster
renly	Hes still my older brother
renly	What are you doing?
loras	Look at it
renly	You cut me
loras	Its just blood Weve all got it in us Sometimes a little spills If you become King, youre going to see a lot of this You need to get used to it Go on Look People love you They love to serve you because youre kind to them They want to be near you
loras	Youre willing to do what needs to be done, but you dont gloat over it You dont love killing Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared You would be a wonderful King -
cersei	Im sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didnt work out You seemed so good together
robert	Im glad I could do something to make you happy
cersei	Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces
robert	I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime
cersei	No Hes not serious enough Ill say this for Ned Stark hes serious enough Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
robert	I dont know But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea We wont be able to stop them
cersei	The Dothraki dont sail Every child knows that They dont have discipline They dont have armor They dont have siege weapons
robert	Its a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your fathers voice comes out
cersei	Is my father wrong?
robert	Lets say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back We hole up in our castles, a wise move Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field They leave us in our castles They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who cant hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all
cersei	We still outnumber them
robert	Which is the bigger number five or one?
cersei	Five
robert	Five one One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose Our purpose died with the Mad King Now weve got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse And everybody wants something different Your father wants to own the world Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow
cersei	What do you want?
robert	We havent had a real fight in nine years Back-stabbing doesnt prepare you for a fight And thats all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing Sometimes I dont know what holds it together
cersei	Our marriage
robert	Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together Dont you get tired?
cersei	Every day
robert	How long can hate hold a thing together?
cersei	Well, seventeen years is quite a long time
robert	Yes, it is
cersei	Yes, it tis What was she like?
robert	Youve never asked about her, not once Why not?
cersei	At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her I thought if I didnt talk about her, shed just fade away for you When I realized that wasnt going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite I didnt want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask And eventually it became clear that my spite didnt mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it
robert	So why now?
cersei	What harm could Lyanna Starks ghost do to either of us that we havent done to each other a hundred times over?
robert	You want to know the horrible truth? I cant even remember what she looked like I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldnt fill the hole she left behind
cersei	I felt something for you once, you know?
robert	I know
cersei	Even after we lost our first boy for quite a while, actually Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment?
robert	No Does that make you feel better or worse?
cersei	It doesnt make me feel anything -
mhaegen	She looks like him, dont she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair
ned	Aye
mhaegen	Tell him when you see him, my Lord If it please you Tell him how beautiful she is
ned	I will
mhaegen	And tell him Ive been with no one else I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new I dont want no jewels or nothing, just him ing was always good to me
ned	When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
mhaegen	He wasnt that sort of man, my Lord He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy
ned	She looks healthy enough to me The girl shall want for nothing
littlefinger	Brothels make a much better investment than ship, Ive found Whores rarely sink
ned	What do you know of King Roberts bastards?
littlefinger	Well, he has more than you, for a start
ned	How many?
littlefinger	Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents
ned	And Jon Arryn tracked them all down Why?
littlefinger	He was the Kings Hand Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after He was overcome with fatherly love
ned	Come
ned	Jory
jory cassel	My Lord
jaime	Such a small pack of wolves
jory cassel	Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King
jaime	Was! the Hand of the King Now Im not sure what he is Lord of somewhere very far away
littlefinger	Whats the meaning of this, Lannister?
jaime	Get back inside where its safe Im looking for my brother You remember my brother, dont you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man
ned	I remember him well
jaime	It seems he had some trouble on the road You wouldnt know what happened to him, would you?
ned	He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes
littlefinger	My Lords! Ill bring the City Watch
jaime	Come, Stark Id rather you die sword in hand
jory cassel	If you threaten my Lord again.
jaime	Threaten? As in, Im going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?
ned	You kill me, your brothers a dead man
jaime	Youre right Take him alive! Kill his men
ned	Your pardon, your Grace
cersei	Do you know what your wife has done?
ned	She did nothing I did not command
robert	Who’d have thought she had it in her?
cersei	By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
ned	I am the King’s Hand
cersei	You were the King’s Hand
ned	trying to keep the peace
cersei	You shall now be held accountable
robert	Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you’ll make your peace with Jaime
ned	He butchered my men
cersei	Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime
robert	Quiet, woman
ned	Jaime has fled the city Give me leave to bring him back to justice
cersei	I took you for a king
robert	Hold your tongue
cersei	He’s attacked my brother and abducted the other I should wear the armor and you the gown
cersei	I shall wear this like a badge of honor
robert	Wear it in silence or I’ll honor you again
robert	See what she does to me? My loving wife I should not have hit her That was not That was not kingly
ned	If we don’t act there will be a war
robert	So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King’s Landing She’s had her fun, now put an end to it You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it
ned	And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
robert	I’m half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father I don’t know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits I don’t want to know This is what matters I can’t rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other’s throats, so enough
ned	As you command your Grace With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight
robert	Piss on that! Send a raven I want you to stay I’m the king, I get what I want I never loved my brothers A sad thing for a man to admit, but it’s true You were the brother I chose We’ll talk when I return from the hunt
ned	The hunt?
robert	Killing things clears my head You’ll have to sit on the throne while I’m away You’ll hate it more than I do
ned	The Targaryen girl
robert	Seven hells! Don’t start with her again! The girl will die and I’ll hear no more of it Put on the badge And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I’ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister -

robb	You’re talking about war

robb	Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army
theon	A Lannister put his spear through your father’s leg ingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch

ned	You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane
grand maester pycelle	Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight
littlefinger	I’ve heard him called Tywin Lannister’s mad dog.” I’m sure you have as well Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
grand maester pycelle	If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection, it would be
littlefinger	It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital
grand maester pycelle	Wel
ned	I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert Lord Beric Dondarrion
ned	You shall have the command Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep
beric dondarrion	As you command
ned	In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes I denounce him and attaint him I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death
grand maester pycelle	My lord This This is a drastic action It would be better to wait for King Robert’s return
grand maester pycelle	My Lord
ned	Send a raven to Casterly Rock Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm
littlefinger	A bold move, my Lord, and admirable But is it wise to yank the lion’s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms Gold wins wars, not soldiers
ned	Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister? -
robin arryn	Is it over?
lysa arryn	You don’t fight with honor

viserys	Tell him I want what was bargained for or I’m taking you back He can keep the baby I’ll cut it out and leave it for him
viserys	What’s he saying?
daenerys	He says yes You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold
viserys	That was all I wanted W-what was promised
viserys	No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh
jorah	Look away Khaleesi
daenerys	No
viserys	No Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can’t
viserys	Dany please
khal drogo	A crown for a king
jorah	Khaleesi
daenerys	He was no dragon Fire cannot kill a dragon
jaime	Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain Uh, arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown Poor Ned Stark Brave man, terrible judgment
tywin	Attacking him was stupid
tywin	Lannisters dont act like fools Are you gonna say something clever? Go on, say something clever
jaime	Catelyn Stark took my brother
tywin	Why is he still alive?
jaime	Tyrion?
tywin	Ned Stark
jaime	One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him
tywin	Why is he still alive?
jaime	It wouldnt have been clean
tywin	Clean.
tywin	You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you
jaime	I could care less what anyone thinks of me
tywin	Now thats what you want people to think of you
jaime	Its the truth
tywin	When you hear them whispering Kingslayer behind your back, doesnt it bother you?
jaime	Of course it bothers me
tywin	The lion doesnt concern himself with the opinions of the sheep I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness Im giving you half of our forces 30,000 men You will bring them to Catelyn Starks girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts
jaime	I didnt realize you placed such a high value on my brothers life
tywin	Hes a Lannister He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but hes one of us And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect
jaime	So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of
tywin	No, its not an opinion, its a fact! If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared Your mothers dead Before long Ill be dead And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground Its the family name that lives on Its all that lives on Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family Do you understand?
tywin	Hmm Youre blessed with abilities that few men possess You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms And you are still blessed with youth And what have you done with these blessings, huh? Youve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings One a madman, the other a drunk The future of our family will be determined in these next few months We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did I need you to become a man you were always meant to be Not next year Not tomorrow Now
cersei	Youre in pain
ned	Ive had worse, my lady
cersei	Perhaps its time to go home
ned	The South doesnt seem to agree with you
ned	I know the truth Jon Arryn died for
cersei	Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
ned	Has he done this before?
cersei	Jaime would have killed him
cersei	My brother is worth a thousand of your friend
ned	Your brother Or your lover?
cersei	The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure
cersei	Jaime and I are more than brother and sister We shared a womb We came into this world together We belong together
ned	My son saw you with him
cersei	Do you love your children?
ned	With all my heart
cersei	No more than I love mine
ned	And they are all Jaimes
cersei	Thank the Gods In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways In the morning, he doesnt remember
ned	Youve always hated him
cersei	Hated him? I worshiped him Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, Lyanna Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me
ned	When the King returns from his hunt, Ill tell him the truth You must be gone by then You and your children I will not have their blood on my hands Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can Because wherever you go, Roberts wrath will follow you
cersei	And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself Jaime told me about the day Kings Landing fell He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself Such a sad mistake
ned	Ive made many mistakes in my life, but that wasnt one of them
cersei	Oh, but it was When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die There is no middle ground
ros	Come here Oh yes, oh Oh yes yes yes
littlefinger	No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you wherever youre from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that Im saying?
ros	Yes, My Lord
littlefinger	Lets start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman Well, go ahead Slowly Youre not fooling them They just paid you They know what you are They know its all just an act Your job is to make them forget what they know That takes time You need to Ease into it Go ahead Ease into it Hes winning you over in spite of yourself Youre starting to like this He wants to believe you Hes enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it Why shouldnt you? He knows hes better than other men Hes always known it deep down inside Now he has proof Hes so good, hes reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there Overcoming your very nature
ros	Why dont you join us, My Lord?
littlefinger	Im saving myself for another
ros	What she doesnt know wont hurt her
littlefinger	A stupid saying What we dont know is usually what gets us killed
ros	She must be very beautiful
littlefinger	No, not really Impeccable bloodlines though
ros	I do believe my lords in love
littlefinger	For many years Most of my life really Play with her ass And she loved me too I was her little confidant, her plaything She could tell me anything, anything at all She told me about all the horses that she liked The castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry A northerner with a jaw like an anvil So I challenged him to a duel I mean, why not? Id read all the stories The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories In the end, she wouldnt even let him kill me Hes just a boy , she said Please dont hurt him So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went
ros	Is she still married to him?
littlefinger	Oh no He got himself killed before the wedding And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen She loves him, Im afraid And why wouldnt she? I mean, who could compare to him? Hes just so good Do you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that Ill never win Not that way Thats their game, their rules Im not going to fight them Im going to fuck them Thats what I know Thats what I am And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want
ros	And what do you want?
littlefinger	Oh, everything, my dear Everything there is Now wash yourselves Both of you are working tonight Hmm
sraw theon	Youre a very lucky girl Do you know that? Where I come from, we dont show mercy to criminals Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord, at low tide wed lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes The sea would come in closer and closer Youd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time
osha	Where is it you come from?
theon	The Iron Islands
osha	They far away?
theon	Youve never heard of the Iron Islands?
osha	Trust me, youve never heard where Im from neither
theon	Trust me, My Lord Youre not living in the wilderness anymore In civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles
osha	And whats that?
theon	Lord
osha	Why?
theon	Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands
osha	Whats that got to do with you? If your fathers lord, how can you be lord too?
theon	I will be lord after my father
osha	So youre not lord now?
theon	No, you You having a go at me? Is that it?
osha	I just dont understand how you Southerners do things
theon	Im not a Southerner
osha	Youre from South of the wall That makes you a Southerner to me
theon	Youre an impudent little wench, arent you?
osha	Couldnt say, My Lord Dont know what impunent means
theon	Impudent It means rude Disrespectful Do you want to lose that chain?
maester luwin	! The lady is our guest
theon	I thought she was our prisoner
maester luwin	Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
maester luwin	Chances are I wont be nearby the next time that happens
osha	Im used to worse than him
osha	Im used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones
maester luwin	Why did you come here?
osha	Didnt mean to come here Meant to get much further South than this As far South as South goes, before the long night comes
maester luwin	Why? What are you afraid of?
osha	Theres things that sleep in the day and hunt at night
maester luwin	Owls and Shadowcats and.
osha	Im not talking about Owls and Shadowcats
maester luwin	The things you speak of theyve been gone for thousands of years
osha	They wasnt gone, old man They was sleeping And they aint sleeping no more

robert	Give it to the council after Im dead At least theyll say I did this right, this one thing Youll rule now Youll hate it worse than I did, but youll do it well The girl, Daenerys You were right Varys, Littlefinger, my brother Worthless No one to tell me no but you Only you Let her live Stop it, if its not too late

ned	Give him milk of the poppy
barristan selmy	He was reeling from the wine He commanded us to step aside, but I failed him
ned	No man could have protected him from himself
varys	I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?
barristan selmy	His squire, from the kings own skin
ned	His squire? The Lannister boy?
varys	Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself
ned	His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them At once
varys	Im afraid those birds have flown.The girl is likely dead already
khal drogo	The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs
daenerys	According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world
khal drogo	The earth ends at the black salt sea No horse can cross the poison water
daenerys	The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea The dirt where I was born
khal drogo	Not dirt Lands
daenerys	Lands, yes There are thousands of ships in the free cities Wooden horses that fly across the sea
khal drogo	Lets speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs
daenerys	Its not a chair Its a.
thronekhal drogo	Throne?
daenerys	A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen
khal drogo	A King does not need a chair to sit upon He only needs a horse
daenerys	Cant you help me make him understand?
jorah	The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons Have patience, Khaleesi We will go home, I promise you
daenerys	My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms Have I said something funny, Ser?
jorah	Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didnt seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right He had no right to them He seized them because he could
daenerys	And because he had dragons
jorah	Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier
daenerys	You dont believe it
jorah	Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report As for the rest It was 300 years ago Who knows what really happened? Now if youll pardon me, Ill seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me
daenerys	Well, Ill come with you
jorah	No no, dont trouble yourself Enjoy the market Ill rejoin you soon enough

daenerys	Is something wrong?
jorah	I have a thirst Open it
wine merchant	The wine is for the Khaleesi Its not for the likes of you
jorah	Open it
jorah	Pour
wine merchant	It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe
daenerys	Do as he says
wine merchant	As the princess commands
wine merchant	Sweet, isnt it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue
jorah	You first
wine merchant	Me? Im afraid I am not worthy of the vintage Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares
daenerys	You will drink
doreah	Khaleesi! Stop him
jorah	Come Not much, really But theres food

jeor	Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
sam	No, my lord I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.Alliser ThorneL Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?

jon	Will I serve the Lord Commanders meals and fetch hot water for his bath
maester aemon	Certainly And keep a fire burning in his chambers Change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you
jon	Do you take me for a servant?
maester aemon	We took you for a man of The Nights Watch But perhaps we were wrong in that
jon	May I go?
maester aemon	As you wish
sam	Jon, wait! Dont you see what theyre doing?
jon	I see Ser Allisers revenge, thats all He wanted it and he got it Stewards are nothing but maids! Im a better swordsman and rider than any of you! Its not fair
pypar	Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock I pushed him away and he said hed have my hands cut off for stealing their silver So now Im here At the end of the world with no one to sing for, but old men and little shits like you Ill never see my family again Ill never be inside a woman again So dont tell me about fair
sam	I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
pypar	You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
sam	Could you sing me a song, Pyp? Id like to hear a song
sam	Now listen to me The old man is the Lord Commander of The Nights Watch Youll be with him day and night Yes, youll clean his clothes.But youll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle Youll know everything, be part of everything And he asked for you himself He wants to groom you for command
jon	I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger
sam	I always wanted to be a Wizard What? No, Im serious So youll stay and say your words with me?
renly	She wont care Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command
ned	And what should I do with a hundred swords?
renly	Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us
ned	What about Stannis?
renly	Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis? You have odd notions about protecting the realm
ned	Stannis is your older brother
renly	This isnt about the bloody line of succession That didnt matter when you rebelled against the Mad King It shouldnt matter now Whats best for the Kingdoms? Whats best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is He inspires no love or loyalty Hes not a King I am
ned	Stannis is a commander Hes led men into war twice He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet
renly	Yes, hes a good soldier Everyone knows that So was Robert
tell me something	Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
ned	I will not dishonor Roberts last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds
ned	You will sail to dragonstone tonight You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife Only Stannis himself
tomard	Yes, My Lord
ned	Now leave us
littlefinger	My Lord protector
ned	ing has no true born sons Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannisters bastards
littlefinger	So when the King dies.
ned	The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis
littlefinger	So it would seem Unless.
ned	There is no unless He is the rightful heir Nothing can change that
littlefinger	And he cannot take the throne without your help You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds
ned	Do you have a shred of honor?
littlefinger	You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm All of the power is yours You need only reach out and take it Make peace with the Lannisters Release the Imp Wed your daughter to Joffrey We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead
ned	We?
littlefinger	Youll need someone to share these burdens I assure you, my price would be modest
ned	What you suggest is treason
littlefinger	Only if we lose
ned	Make peace with the Lannisters, you say With the people who tried to murder my boy
ned	No I wont do it
littlefinger	So it will be Stannis and war?
ned	There is no other choice He is the heir
littlefinger	So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly
ned	You promised Catelyn you would help me The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard I need the gold cloaks The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the Kings peace
littlefinger	Look at you You know what you want me to do You know it has to be done, but its not honorable so the words stick in your throat When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect? Who do they follow? The man who pays them
daenerys	I thought hed leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.He will never leave you alone If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him He will never abandon the hunt Youre a Targaryen The last Targaryen Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him
daenerys	He will not have my son
khal drogo	Moon of my life Are you hurt?
khal drogo	Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.I make this gift to you And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world I will also pledge a gift
king joffrey	Liar
cersei	You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark Ser Barristan, seize this traitor
ned	Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man Do him no harm
cersei	You think he stands alone?
king joffrey	Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it
ned	Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard
janos slynt	Men of the Watch

ned	What about my daughters?
varys	The younger one seems to have escaped the castle Even my little birds cannot find her
ned	And Sansa?
varys	Still engaged to Joffrey Cersei will keep her close The rest of your household though, all dead, it grieves me to say I do so hate the sight of blood
ned	You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing
varys	And would again, My Lord I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords When you look at me do you see a hero? What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffreys birth?
ned	The madness of mercy That she might save her children
varys	Ah, the children It is always the innocents who suffer It wasnt the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
ned	The Queen cant kill me Cat holds her brother
varys	The wrong brother sadly And lost to her Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers
ned	If thats true, then slit my throat and be done with it
varys	Not today, My Lord

greatjon umber	No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannisters siege of Riverrun Do that and the River Lords will join us
robb	To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins
theon	Lord Frey controls that bridge Your fathers bannerman
catelyn	The late Lord Frey my father calls him At the Trident, he didnt appear until the battle was done Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others

barristan selmy	Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood Our vows are taken for life Only death relieves us of our sacred trust
cersei	Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your Kings?
king joffrey	You let my father die Youre too old to protect anybody
barristan selmy	Your Grace.
cersei	The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

cersei	Careful, Ser
varys	We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need
barristan selmy	A hall to die in and men to bury me I am a Knight I shall die a Knight

kings landing page	The Lady Sansa of House Stark
cersei	Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
sansa	I do
sansa	As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King
grand maester pycelle	Treason is a noxious weed It should be torn out, root.
king joffrey	Let her speak I want to hear what she says
sansa	Thank you, Your Grace
littlefinger	Do you deny your fathers crime?
sansa	No, My Lords I know he must be punished All I ask is mercy I know My Lord father must regret what he did He was King Roberts friend and he loved him You all know he loved him He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him They must have lied to him Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody They must have lied
king joffrey	He said I wasnt the King Why did he say that?
sansa	He was badly hurt Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy He wasnt himself Otherwise h never would have said it
varys	A childs faith Such sweet innocence And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes

varys	Youve seen better days, my lord
ned	Another visit? lt seems youre my last friend
varys	No, no, many still love you Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life
ned	On her knees begging for me Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
varys	You do me wrong, my lord Your blood is the last thing l want
ned	l dont know what you want lve given up trying to guess
varys	When l was still a boy before they cut my balls off with a hot knife l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities They taught me that each man has a role to play The same is true at court l am the master of whisperers My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples lm a good actor, my lord
ned	Huh Can you free me from this pit?
varys	l could But will l? No As l said, Im no hero
ned	What do you want? Tell me No riddles, no stories Tell me, what do you want?
varys	Peace Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad Fighting for his fathers freedom
ned	Robb? Hes just a boy
varys	Boys have been conquerors before But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the kings the late kings brother Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy
ned	Stannis Baratheon is Roberts true heir The throne is his by rights
varys	Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life lt would be a shame to throw it away Cersei is no fool She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one
ned	You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
varys	l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir Cersei knows you as a man of honor lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son
ned	You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of of what? You grew up with actors You learned their craft and you learnt it well But l grew up with soldiers l learned how to die a long time ago
varys	Pity Such a pity What of your daughters life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you? e
robb	lts a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda
theon	Or so Walder Frey would have you think
catelyn	Keep shooting them down We cant risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters
robb	Hes Grandfathers bannerman We cant expect his support?
greatjon umber	Expect nothing of Walder Frey and youll never be surprised Look
robb	Father rots in a dungeon How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now
theon	Just march up to his gates and tell him youre crossing Weve got five times his numbers You can take the Twins if you have to
greatjon umber	Not in time Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak
catelyn	The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll
robb	Have my horse saddled and ready
greatjon umber	Enter the Twins alone and hell sell you to the Lannisters as he likes
theon	Or throw you in a dungeon Or slit your throat
robb	My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing Whatever it took lf lm going to lead this army, l cant have other men doing my bargaining for me
catelyn	l agree lll go
everyone	You cant
catelyn	l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl He would never harm me
greatjon umber	Unless there was a profit in it er
walder frey	What do you want?

walder frey	Huh Didnt come to the last one, either Or the one before that Your family has always pissed on me
catelyn	My lord, l
walder frey	Dont deny it You know its true The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine
catelyn	lm sure there were reasons
walder frey	l didnt need reasons l needed to get rid of sons and daughters You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
catelyn	To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way
walder frey	Why should l let him?
catelyn	lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls
walder frey	There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here Dont try and frighten me, Lady Stark Your husbands in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your sons got no fur to keep his balls warm
catelyn	You swore an oath to my father
walder frey	Oh, yes, l said some words And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right Joffreys king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, ld hand you both over to the Lannisters
catelyn	Why dont you?
walder frey	Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you? -
voices outside	And engage
jeor	When does Aemon think youll be able to use that hand?
jon	Soon, he says
jeor	Good Youll be ready for this, then l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made lts called Longclaw Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think
jon	This is Valyrian steel
jeor	lt was my fathers sword, his father before him The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries lt was meant for my son Jorah He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros
jon	My lord, you honor me, but l cant
jeor	Oh, you can And you will l wouldnt be standing here if it wasnt for you and your beast A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so youll take it lll hear no more about it ls that understood?
jon	Yes, my lord
jeor	Right Now, dont think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne Thats a mans sword ltll take a man to wield it
jon	lll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight
jeor	No, you wont l sent him to Kings Landing yesterday The hand that your wolf tore off that things wrist – lve ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king That should get young Joffreys attention And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper
jon	Yes, my lord Unidentified Night
watchers	Well done Well done.Night
watcher	You earned that, Snow.Night
watcher	Well done

sam	lm really not supposed to say
jon	And yet you really want to say You want to say that
sam	There was a raven l read the message to Maester Aemon lts your brother Robb
jon	What? What about him?
sam	Hes heading south To war All his bannermen have rallied to his side, theyll keep him safe
jon	l should be there l should be with him -
greatjon umber	lf we do that, theyll never get back across
robb	Well? What did he say?
catelyn	Lord Walder has granted your crossing His men are yours, as well
robb	Huh
catelyn	Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you
robb	What does he want in return?
catelyn	You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire He expects a knighthood in good time
robb	Fine, fine And?
catelyn	And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age
robb	She wont be happy about that And?
catelyn	And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters Whichever you prefer He has a number he thinks will be suitable

catelyn	Not if you want to cross
robb	Then l consent -
jon	Sam said you wanted to see me?
maester aemon	l did indeed Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Nights Watch take no wives and father no children?
jon	No
maester aemon	So they will not love Love is the death of duty lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
jon	He would do whatever was right, no matter what
maester aemon	Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000 Most of us are not so strong What is honor compared to a womans love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brothers smile?
jon	Sam told you
maester aemon	Were all human Oh, we all do our duty when theres no cost to it Honor comes easy then Yet sooner or later in every mans life there comes a day when it is not easy A day when he must choose
jon	And this is my day? ls that what youre saying?
maester aemon	Oh, it hurts, boy Oh, yes l know
jon	You do not know No one knows l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother
maester aemon	The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows They waited till l was old What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail But when l heard they had killed my brothers son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children
jon	Who are you?
maester aemon	My father was Maekar, the first of his name My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King
jon	Youre Aemon Targaryen
maester aemon	lm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Nights Watch l will not tell you to stay or go You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days As l have -
daenerys	My lord My sun and stars Drogo
khal drogo	My horse
cohollo	Blood of my blood
khal drogo	No, l must ride

daenerys	Hes tired, thats all He needs to rest Weve ridden far enough today Well camp here
qotho	This is no place to camp A woman does not give us orders Not even a Khaleesi
daenerys	Well camp here Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it
qotho	You do not command me, Khaleesi
daenerys	Find Mirri Maz Duur Bring her to me

qotho	Hyah! Hyah!
kevan	Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Freys levies in tow Theyre a days march north
tywin	The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage
tyrion	Oh, do continue Didnt mean to interrupt
tywin	l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise weve wasted good steel on them
kevan	The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes Heavy black steel, double-sided
tyrion	Shagga likes axes
tywin	When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard
tyrion	The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
kevan	They do seem rather ferocious
tyrion	Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay
tywin	When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander
tyrion	Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort
tywin	Therell be no more discussion on the matter
tyrion	lt appears lm not hungry after all Excuse me, my lords.Back at his tent, Tyrion finds Bronn there with a woman waiting there too
tyrion	Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
bronn	l took her
tyrion	Took her? From whom?
bronn	From, uh, Ser Whats-his-name? l dont know Ginger cunt, three tents down
tyrion	And he didnt have anything to say about it?
bronn	He said something
tyrion	Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically Well be at the vanguard tomorrow
bronn	Oh, well l, uh, think lll go and find myself one
tyrion	Who are you?

tyrion	What did your mother call you?
prostitute	Shae What did your mother call you?

shae	And what do l get?
tyrion	One safety No one will hurt you for as long as youre mine Two the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular
shae	Who told you this? Women you paid?
tyrion	And three more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years Do you accept my proposal?
shae	Lets start with your last night in this world Back across the Narrow Sea Drogo is mumbling incoherently in Dothraki inside a tent, Daenerys by his side
jorah	Khaleesi
daenerys	Come Hes very strong No one understands how strong he is

daenerys	l have never been nothing l am the blood of the dragon
qotho	The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi
daenerys	l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser
jorah	l think youre right
mirri maz duur	Youve saved me once more
daenerys	And now you must save him
mirri maz duur	Hes beyond the healers skills All l can do is ease his path
daenerys	Save him and l will free you l swear it You must know a way Some – some magic
mirri maz duur	There is a spell Some would say death is cleaner
daenerys	Do it Save him
mirri maz duur	There is a price

bronn	You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers
tyrion	Another night, perhaps
shae	Not another night This night
tyrion	lts not a pleasant story
shae	Oh, maybe l will cry
bronn	lm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship
tyrion	So l was 16 My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her Her name was Tysha She was a wheelwrights orphan And she was hungry Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine l forgot how afraid l was around girls how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother l forgot about everything but Tysha And somehow l found myself in her bed
bronn	For three chickens, l should hope so
tyrion	lt didnt last long l didnt know what the hell l was doing But she was good to me She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it man and wife For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father
bronn	Well, l imagine that was the end of all that
tyrion	Not quite First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth The girl was a whore, you see Jaime had arranged the whole thing the road, the rapers, all of it He thought it was time l had a woman After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards He paid her well a silver for each man How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor
bronn	l would have killed the man who did that to me
shae	You should have known she was a whore
tyrion	Really? l was 16, drunk and in love
shae	A girl who was almost raped doesnt invite another man into her bed two hours later
tyrion	As l said, l was young and stupid
shae	You are still young and stupid
tyrion	What is it? What do you want?
bronn	Youre sleeping through the war
tyrion	What?
bronn	They stole a nights march on us Theyre a mile north
tyrion	Get my squire
bronn	You dont have a squire
tyrion	lf l die, weep for me
shae	Youll be dead How will you know?
tyrion	lll know
soldier	Watch out! Move
soldier	Out of the way! Move aside
bronn	Stay low
tyrion	Stay low?
bronn	lf youre lucky, no one will notice you
tyrion	l was born lucky Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours! Tribesmen of the Vale Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man
tyrion	To battle
bronn	Youre a shit warrior
tyrion	lm alive?
bronn	Youre alive
tyrion	Did we win?
bronn	We wouldnt be having this conversation if we didnt
tyrion	How did our tribesmen do?
bronn	Yeah, good
tyrion	lts nice to see them getting along
tywin	Youre wounded
tyrion	Good of you to notice l hear we won
tywin	Huh! The scouts were wrong There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20
tyrion	Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
tywin	He wasnt here
tyrion	Where was he?
tywin	With his other 18,000 men
tyrion	And where are they? -
rodrik cassel	We should go, my lady
catelyn	No
rodrik cassel	My lady
bannermen	Hyah! Hyah
robb	By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened
jaime	Lady Stark ld offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it
catelyn	lt is not your sword l want Give me my daughters back Give me my husband
jaime	lve lost them too, lm afraid
theon	Kill him, Robb Send his head to his father He cut down ten of our men You saw him
robb	Hes more use to us alive than dead
catelyn	Take him away and put him in irons
jaime	We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters Swords or lances, teeth, nails choose your weapons and lets end this here and now
robb	lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, youd win Were not doing it your way
greatjon umber	Come on, pretty man
robb	l sent 2,000 men to their graves today
theon	The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice
robb	Aye But the dead wont hear them One victory does not make us conquerors Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over

grand maester pycelle	As we sin, so do we suffer This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
joffrey	My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Nights Watch Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father But they have the soft hearts of women So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished Ser Ilyn, bring me his head

joffrey	Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his hand, leaving her lip bloodied Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below She moves forward to lunge him from the edge, but she’s stopped by the Hound
sandor clegane	Here, girl
joffrey	Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? lll look for you in court
sandor clegane	Save yourself some pain, girl Give him what he wants
sandor clegane	Youll be needing that again -
jonos bracken	The proper course is clear pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his
robb	Renly is not the king
jonos bracken	You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord He put your father to death
robb	That doesnt make Renly king Hes Roberts youngest brother lf Bran cant be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly cant be king before Stannis
jonos bracken	Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
galbart glover	Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis
greatjon umber	My Lords My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldnt we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to the King in the North
rickard kar	lll have peace on those terms They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too ing in the North

catelyn	Leave us
jaime	You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark Widowhood becomes you Your bed must be lonely ls that why you came? lm not at my best, but l think l could be of service You slip out of that gown and well see if lm up to it Oh, l do like a violent woman
catelyn	l will kill you tonight, Ser Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister
jaime	Let me show you how Hit me again, over the ear And again and again Youre stronger than you look, it shouldnt take long
catelyn	That is what you want the world to believe, isnt it? That you dont fear death
jaime	But l dont, my lady The dark is coming for all of us Why cry about it?
catelyn	Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just
jaime	What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
catelyn	Because of men like you
jaime	There are no men like me Only me
catelyn	My son Bran How did he come to fall from that tower?

cersei	Stop talking Get back into bed
tywin	They have my son

leo lefford	lve heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses
addam marbrand	ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
kevan	Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us Jaime captured, his armies scattered lts a catastrophe Perhaps we should sue for peace
tyrion	Theres your peace Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Starks head Youll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now Hes winning – in case you hadnt noticed
kevan	lm told we still have his sisters
leo lefford	The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime
kevan	First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise
tywin	They have my son! Get out, all of you Not you You were right about Eddard Stark lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Roberts brothers But now – madness Madness and stupidity l always thought you were a stunted fool Perhaps l was wrong
tyrion	Half wrong lm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we cant stay here
tywin	No one will stay here Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Gods Eye to the Red Fork The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal And you will go to Kings Landing
tyrion	And do what?
tywin	Rule You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle
tyrion	Heads, spikes, walls Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?
tywin	Youre my son Oh, one more thing You will not take that whore to court Do you understand?

mirri maz duur	Monstrous, twisted l pulled him out myself He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat When l touched him the skin fell from his bones Inside he was full of graveworms l warned you that only death can pay for life You knew the price
daenerys	Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me Show me what l bought with my sons life
mirri maz duur	As you command, lady Come l will take you to him
jorah	Time enough for that later

jorah	He seems to like the warmth, Princess
mirri maz duur	He lives You asked for life, you paid for life
daenerys	This is not life When will he be as he was?
mirri maz duur	When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east When the seas go dry When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves
daenerys	Leave us
jorah	l dont want you alone with this sorceress
daenerys	l have nothing more to fear from this woman Go
daenerys	You knew what l was buying and you knew the price
mirri maz duur	lt was wrong of them to burn my temple lt angered the Great Shepherd
daenerys	This is not Gods work My child was innocent
mirri maz duur	lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World Now he will burn no cities Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust
daenerys	l spoke for you l saved you
mirri maz duur	Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl l saw my gods house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
daenerys	Your life
mirri maz duur	Why dont you take a look at your khal Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone -

daenerys	When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars In King’s Landing, Pycelle is having a conversation with someone in his bedchambers
grand maester pycelle	Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, lve known truly known more kings than any man alive Theyre complicated men, but l know how to serve them Yes, and keep on serving them Aerys Targaryen Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst He was a good man Such a charmer To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign
grand maester pycelle	He is a capable young man Strong military mind Stern But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice lts far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King Mmm True greatness
ros	So whats the thing?
grand maester pycelle	What thing?
ros	About kings You said, The thing you need to understand about kings
grand maester pycelle	What? Things? What?

varys	When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
littlefinger	lts hard for them to simper and bow without heads
varys	A man with great ambition and no morals l wouldnt bet against you
littlefinger	And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
varys	l must be one of the few men in this city who doesnt want to be King

varys	Oh, you can do better than that
littlefinger	When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? lve always wondered
varys	Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering whats between my legs?
littlefinger	l picture a gash Like a womans ls that about right?
varys	l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all
littlefinger	Must be strange for you, even after all these years a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all
varys	Am l? That is good to know Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
littlefinger	But you carry on whispering in one kings ear and then the next l admire you
varys	And l admire you, Lord Baelish A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women
littlefinger	A useful talent, lm sure youd agree
varys	So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect

joffrey	What kind of stupid peasants superstition.
sandor	The girl is right What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year
joffrey	Take him away Ill have him killed tomorrow, the fool

tyrion	Beloved nephew
tyrion	We looked for you on the battlefield You were nowhere to be found
joffrey	Ive been here, ruling the kingdoms
tyrion	What a fine job youve done Look at you More beautiful than ever And you! You, youre going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking This one doesnt like me
bronn	Cant imagine why
joffrey	We heard you were dead
myrcella	Im glad youre not dead
tyrion	Me, too, dear Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world My Lady, Im sorry for your loss
joffrey	Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor
tyrion	But still her father Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize
sansa	My father was a traitor My mother and brother are traitors, too I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey
tyrion	Of course you are
tyrion	Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done
joffrey	What work? Why are you here?
pycelle	The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last The longest summer in living memory
varys	The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter
pycelle	A common superstition
littlefinger	We have enough wheat for a five-year winter If it lasts any longer, , well have fewer peasants
janos	The citys drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, itll only get worse
cersei	You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?
janos	I do, Your Grace
cersei	And are you not a Lord at my command?
janos	I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace
cersei	Then do your job Shut the gates to the peasants They belong in the field, not our capital
janos	Yes, Your Grace
tyrion	Dont get up More ravishing than ever, big sister War agrees with you Forgive the interruption, carry on
cersei	What are you doing here?
tyrion	Its been a remarkable journey I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell I fought with the hill tribes So many adventures, so much to be thankful for
cersei	What are you doing here? This is the small council
tyrion	Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings
cersei	Our father is Hand of the King
tyrion	Yes, but in his absence
varys	Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights
cersei	Out! All of you out I would like to know how you tricked father into this
tyrion	If I were capable of tricking father, Id be emperor of the world by now You brought this on yourself
cersei	Ive done nothing
tyrion	Quite right You did nothing when your son called for Ned Starks head Now the entire North has risen up against us
cersei	I tried to stop it
tyrion	Did you? You failed That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation
cersei	Robb Stark is a child
tyrion	Whos won every battle hes fought Do you understand were losing the war?
cersei	What do you know about warfare?
tyrion	Nothing But I know people And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us
cersei	Joffrey is King
tyrion	Joffrey is King
cersei	You are here to advise him
tyrion	Im only here to advise him And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back
cersei	How?
tyrion	You love your children Its your one redeeming quality That and your cheekbones The Starks love their children as well And we have two of them
cersei	One
tyrion	One?
cersei	Arya, little animal, she disappeared
tyrion	Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade You chopped ones head off and let another escape Father will be furious It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child
lord	My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
lord	The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and Im afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers hammers When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhens Square in a summer Men worked back then Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps And the Gods forbid it rains Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall
luwin	Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast
lord	Generally, yes, but Ive sent all the young men off to fight Robb Starks war
bran	King Robb And its not his war He didnt choose it
lord	Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men
bran	Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord Do you remember your vows, Ser?
lord	Of course I remember
luwin	We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?
lord	I I believe it will
luwin	We didnt want him here all day, did we?
bran	I didnt like the way he was talking about Robb
luwin	Nor did I But listening to people youd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell Lord Portan
portan	My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
osha	Boil this for an hour and drink the tea Makes all your pain go away
bran	Dont have any pain
osha	Lucky for you
bran	That way
osha	Youve been having those dreams again
bran	I dont dream
osha	Everyone dreams
bran	I dont Heard some of the men talking about the comet They say its an omen They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South
osha	Did they? I heard some other fools say its Lannister Red Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long I heard a stable boy say its the color of blood, to mark the death of your father
osha	The stars dont fall for men The red comet means one thing, boy Dragons
bran	The dragons are all dead Theyve been dead for centuries
doreah	What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?
daenerys	He said they ate meat
doreah	He didnt tell you what kind of meat?
daenerys	My brother didnt know anything about dragons He didnt know anything about anything
daenerys	She was Drogos first gift to me
jorah	I remember
daenerys	I promised to protect them Promised them their enemies would die screaming How do I make starvation scream?
jorah	A trick I never learned, Im afraid
daenerys	Does it ever end?
jorah	This is further east than Ive ever been But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste
daenerys	And youre sure theres no other way?
jorah	If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons
daenerys	No one will take my dragons
jorah	They are too weak to fight, as are your people You must be their strength
daenerys	As you are mine
daenerys	Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro Take our remaining horses You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast
rakharo	What do we seek, Khaleesi?
daenerys	Cities, living or dead Caravans and people Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side
daenerys	Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood
rakharo	I will not fail you, blood of my blood
daenerys	You never have
rakharo	This is bad time to start
jon	Having a rough time of it?
sam	Nothings killed me yet
grenn	Your ass killed the sledge
sam	You offered me a ride
grenn	I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters

men	ing in the North
roose	Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours Theyre dead Take everything theyve got Weve nowhere to keep all these prisoners Barely enough food to feed our own
robb	Were not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton
roose	Of course, Your Grace The officers will be useful Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannisters plans
robb	I doubt it
roose	Well, well learn soon enough In my family, we say, A naked man has few secrets A flayed man none
robb	My father outlawed flaying in the North
roose	Were not in the North
robb	Were not torturing them
roose	The high roads very pretty, but youll have a hard time marching your army down it
robb	The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own I wont give them an excuse to abuse my sisters
wounded soldier	No, dont! Dont! Please
shhh talisa	The rots set in
wounded soldier	No, dont! No, dont
talisa	Shh
wounded soldier	Please, dont! Itll get better It doesnt even hurt
talisa	The rot will spread If we dont take the foot now WOUNDED
soldier	No, you cant
wounded soldier	Ser! Please, ser
i cant lose robb	Youll die if she doesnt
wounded soldier	I dont want to be a cripple, please
roose	Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub
talisa	Your men are not my men, my lord
robb	Put this in your mouth and lie down You dont want to watch

robb	Bite on it Its better than biting your own tongue, believe me
robb	Whats your name?
talisa	Talisa
robb	Your last name?
talisa	You want to know what side my family fights on?
robb	You know my family name You have me at a disadvantage
talisa	That boy lost his foot on your orders
robb	They killed my father
talisa	That boy did?
robb	The family he fights for
talisa	Do you think hes friends with King Joffrey? Hes a fishermans son that grew up near Lannisport He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago
robb	I have no hatred for the lad
talisa	That should help his foot grow back
robb	Youd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed I understand The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey
talisa	Youre going to kill Joffrey?
robb	If the gods give me strength
talisa	And then what?
robb	I dont know Well go back to Winterfell I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne
talisa	So who will?
robb	I dont know
talisa	Youre fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?
robb	First we have to win the war
robb	You never told me where youre from
talisa	Volantis
robb	Volantis? Youre far from home The boy was lucky you were here
talisa	He was unlucky that you were
joffrey	Youre here to answer for your brothers latest treasons
sansa	Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part You know that I beg you
please joffrey	Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage
lancel	Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves Thousands of good men were butchered After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain
joffrey	Killing you would send your brother a message
joffrey	But my mother insists on keeping you alive Stand So well have to send your brother a message some other way Meryn
joffrey	Leave her face I like her pretty
joffrey	Meryn, my lady is overdressed Unburden her
joffrey	If you want Robb Stark to hear us, were going to have to speak louder
tyrion	What is the meaning of this?
tyrion	What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
meryn	The kind who serves his king, Imp
bronn	Careful, now We dont want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak
tyrion	Someone get the girl something to cover herself with She is to be your queen Have you no regard for her honor?
joffrey	Im punishing her
tyrion	For what crimes? She did not fight her brothers battle, you half-wit
joffrey	You cant talk to me like that The king can do as he likes
tyrion	The Mad King did as he liked Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
meryn	No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard
tyrion	Im not threatening the king, ser I am educating my nephew Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him That was a threat See the difference?
tyrion	I apologize for my nephews behavior Tell me the truth Do you want an end to this engagement?
sansa	I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love
tyrion	Lady Stark, you may survive us yet
bronn	The little kings backed up Clogged from balls to brains
tyrion	You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
bronn	Theres no cure for being a cunt But the boys at that age And hes got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies Couldnt hurt to get some of the poison out
joffrey	What are you doing here, dog?
sandor	Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it
joffrey	And? What is it?
sandor	Look inside, Your Grace
daisy	Your Grace
ros	Happy nameday, Your Grace
joffrey	My nameday has passed
ros	We wont tell if you wont
joffrey	No Her Touch her
joffrey	Could you hit her?
joffrey	My uncle sent you?
daisy	Yes, Your Grace He chose us himself
ros	Hmm
joffrey	Use this
joffrey	Harder
joffrey	I said harder Hed want me to get his moneys worth
ros	Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure
daisy	Please, Your Grace
ros	Your Grace, if your uncle finds out
joffrey	Oh, I want him to find out You will bring her to his chambers when youre finished and show him what youve done, or the same thing will happen to you
joffrey	Begin
joffrey	Harder
renly	Well, if it isnt my favorite whoremonger Pray I havent kept you waiting long
littlefinger	Your Grace
renly	Now you do the Lannisters bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brothers body even cold before you secured your newest patron?
littlefinger	Im a practical man
renly	Just not a loyal one
littlefinger	And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brothers corpse?
renly	I dont like you, Lord Baelish I dont like your face I dont like the words that come oozing out of your mouth I dont want you in my tent one minute more than necessary So tell me, why are you here?
renly	You can trust Brienne Her loyalty comes without charge
littlefinger	You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim
renly	Now I understand You know I have the numbers You know Im marching on Kings Landing When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position And your head
littlefinger	I would give priority to my head
littlefinger	I understand that you dont like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection When you march on Kings Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates
littlefinger	Your Grace
margaery	Lord Baelish
littlefinger	All of these tents look the same to me -Would you be so kind
margaery	It would be my pleasure It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress And the moment I learn which tent is mine, were on the move again
littlefinger	Your tent ? Not Our tent ? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt Four kings vying for the throne
margaery	I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers
littlefinger	If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world I did notice your brother entering His Graces tent just now
margaery	The place of a Kingsguard is by the kings side
littlefinger	And on the night of your wedding, who was by the kings side then?
margaery	You seem quite interested in our marriage
littlefinger	Your marriage is quite interesting Not only to me, but to the realm The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else
margaery	Youve never married, have you?
littlefinger	Ive been unlucky in my affections, sadly
margaery	That is sad Though perhaps its for the best The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain My husband is my king, and my king is my husband Here is your tent, Lord Baelish Good night
daenerys	This isnt your horse
kovarro	It was given to me by the Thirteen The Elders of Qarth
daenerys	Qarth?
kovarro	Three days to the east, on the sea
daenerys	Will they let us in?
kovarro	They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons
daenerys	What do you know of this place?
jorah	Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows
man	Go on
man	You, keep moving

catelyn	How dare you?
littlefinger	You may have heard false reports
catelyn	You betrayed Ned
littlefinger	Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm I begged him to seize the moment
catelyn	I trusted you My husband trusted you And you repaid our faith with treachery
littlefinger	No, my lady
catelyn	Get out
littlefinger	Cat, Ive Ive loved you since I was a boy It seems to me that fate has given us this chance
catelyn	Have you lost your mind? Get out
littlefinger	Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?
catelyn	You have Arya, too?
littlefinger	Both girls are healthy and safe For now But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital
catelyn	What do you want?
littlefinger	The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer
catelyn	Of course they will Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms
littlefinger	Im not bringing these terms to him Im bringing them to you
catelyn	You think I keep secrets from my son?
littlefinger	Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but hes not a mother Consider it, Cat You may not get another chance Ive brought you a gift
catelyn	I dont want your gifts A token of Tyrion Lannisters goodwill He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith
catelyn	Good faith?
catelyn	Whats this?
littlefinger	Your husband was an honorable man He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell You may not believe
catelyn	Get out
man	Get up, you dogs
hot pie	Thats him, the one who picks
arya	The Mountain What are you doing?

stannis	Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands
catelyn	I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis
renly	Can that truly be you?
stannis	Who else might it be?
renly	When I saw your standard, I couldnt be sure Whose banner is that?
stannis	My own
renly	I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing Why is your stag on fire?
melisandre	The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light
renly	Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age
stannis	Watch yourself, Renly
renly	No, no, Im relieved I never really believed you were a fanatic Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man
melisandre	You should kneel before your brother Hes the Lords chosen, born amidst salt and smoke
renly	Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
stannis	Thats twice Ive warned you
catelyn	Listen to yourselves If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers
stannis	It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark Your husband was a supporter of my claim Lord Eddards integrity cost him his head And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me
catelyn	We share a common enemy
stannis	The Iron Throne is mine by right All those that deny that are my foes
renly	The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers wombs No one wants you for their king You never wanted any friends, brother But a man without friends is a man without power
stannis	For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council Ill even name you my heir until a son is born to me Otherwise I shall destroy you
renly	Look across those fields, brother Can you see all those banners?
stannis	You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
renly	No The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king
stannis	We shall see, Renly Come the dawn, we shall see
melisandre	Look to your sins, Lord Renly The night is dark and full of terrors
renly	Would you believe I loved him once?
daenerys	I thought we were welcome
jorah	If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi
daenerys	Horde?
daenerys	My name is Daenerys SPICE
king	Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen
daenerys	You know me, my lord?
spice king	Only by reputation, Khaleesi And Im no lord, merely a humble merchant They call you the Mother of Dragons
daenerys	And what should I call you?
spice king	Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce I am simply a trader of spices But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be
daenerys	The beauty of Quarth is legendary SPICE KING Qarth
daenerys	Qarth
spice king	Might we see the dragons?
daenerys	My friend, we have traveled very far We have no food, no water Once I see my people fed, I would be honored SPICE
king	Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves
daenerys	I am not a liar
spice king	Oh, I dont think you are But as Ive never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value
daenerys	Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates
spice king	Then perhaps you should return to where you come from We wish you well
daenerys	What are you doing? You promised to receive me
spice king	We have received you Here we are, and here you are
daenerys	If you do not let us in, all of us will die
spice king	Which we shall deeply regret But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates
jorah	Khaleesi, please be careful
daenerys	Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground Turn us away and we will burn you first
spice king	Ah You are a true Targaryen Only, as you said a moment ago, if we dont let you into the city, you will all die
and so xaro	Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be
spice king	The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos The Thirteen have spoken
xaro	I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking
spice king	The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons
xaro	Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still SPICE
king	Our decision is final
xaro	Very well I invoke soumai
xaro	I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law
spice king	Be it on your head
xaro	Welcome to Qarth, my lady
mountain	You
tickler	Is there gold or silver in the village?
gendry	Im not from the village
tickler	Where is the Brotherhood?

mountain	Cells are overflowing, my lord
polliver	This lot wont be here long Dont need no permanent place After we interrogate em

mountain	My lord
tyrion	Your visits are too few, cousin
lancel	Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle Heres your warrant
tyrion	So it is Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep
lancel	I am here at Her Graces behest, not to drink with you, Imp
tyrion	If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought shed come herself Instead she sends you What am I to make of that?
lancel	I dont care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately
tyrion	And youve received these instructions directly from Cersei?
lancel	As I said several times
tyrion	And youve waited this long to deliver the information?
lancel	When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay
tyrion	Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf
lancel	The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities She often works from dusk till dawn
tyrion	She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn
tyrion	Ah Lavender oil She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl
lancel	I am a knight
tyrion	An anointed knight, yes Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?
lancel	You will withdraw these filthy accusations
tyrion	Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out youve been bedding his mother?
lancel	Its not my fault
tyrion	Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?
lancel	Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the Kings squire, he told me to obey her in everything
tyrion	Did he tell you to fuck her, too?
lancel	I only meant I did as I was bid
tyrion	Hated every moment of it, is that what youll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sisters legs spreading open for you at night Oh, yes, it must have been terrible Wait here His Grace will want to hear this
lancel	Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you
tyrion	Save it for Joffrey He loves a good grovel
lancel	My lord, it was your sisters bidding, the Queen Ill leave the city at once, I swear
tyrion	No, I think not
lancel	My lord?
tyrion	You heard me My father told you to obey my sister Obey her Stay close to her side Keep her trust Pleasure her whenever she requires No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything And you will tell me
lancel	Yes, my lord, I will I swear it, as you command
tyrion	Oh, rise, rise Let us drink to our understanding Oh, you dont have a cup Oh, well Smile, cousin My sister is a beautiful woman, and its all for the good of the realm Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent
lancel	But her demands?
tyrion	Oh, Ill give her Pycelle
lancel	You will?
tyrion	Yes, Ill release him in the morning Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true Stay within one table length
davos	Your Grace
stannis	Do your knucklebones bring you luck?
davos	Well, lifes been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace And its four less fingernails to clean
stannis	Fewer
davos	Pardon?
stannis	Four fewer fingernails to clean Never understood why you had to wear them
davos	It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now It reminds me of your justice It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver
stannis	You were a hero and a smuggler A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good
davos	A lesson Ive tried to teach my son
stannis	Does he listen?
davos	To me? Gods, no But if your red woman told him to leap from the crows nest
stannis	She has a name I trust youve not forgotten your smugglers tricks
davos	Ive lived within the law for 17
stannis	I want you to be a smuggler this time
davos	Any shore, any night What am I bringing ashore?
stannis	The red woman No one must know what you do and well not speak of this again
davos	I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways
stannis	Cleaner ways dont win wars
melisandre	Are you afraid, Onion Knight?
davos	Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors
melisandre	Youve carried more unpleasant cargo in your time Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?
davos	Id say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad
melisandre	If half an onion is black with rot, its a rotten onion A man is good or he is evil
davos	And which are you?
melisandre	Oh, good Im a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life
davos	Well, that must be very nice for you
melisandre	Do you love your wife?
davos	I do
melisandre	Yet you have known other women
davos	Dont talk about my wife
melisandre	Im not Im talking about other women Like me, Ser Davos You want me You want to see whats beneath this robe
melisandre	And you will
davos	Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows
melisandre	Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos They are servants of light, the children of fire And the brighter the flame, the darker they are
davos	These werent here before Theyve barred the passage
melisandre	They cant bar our passage
davos	Gods protect us
renly	You swear it?
catelyn	By the mother My son has no interest in the Iron Throne
renly	Then I see no reason for hostility between us Your soncan go on calling himself King in the North The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty
catelyn	And the wording of this oath?
renly	The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together
catelyn	And in return for my sons loyalty?
renly	In the morning, Ill destroy my brothers army
renly	When thats done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before
catelyn	Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle Negotiate a peace with your brother
renly	Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there Id have better luck debating the wind
renly	Please bring my terms to your son I believe we are natural allies I hope he feels the same Together we could end this war in a fortnight
brienne	No! No
soldier	Follow me
soldier	Youll die for this
catelyn	No, wait, it wasnt her
catelyn	Weve got to leave Theyll hang you for this
man	Inside the kings tent
go man	Now
brienne	I wont leave him
catelyn	You cant avenge him if youre dead
man	Over there, go
brienne	Not that way
margaery	We need to go home Loras
littlefinger	My lord, my lady
loras	Get out
littlefinger	Stannis will be here in an hour When he arrives, Renlys bannermen will flock to him Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king
loras	And you want that privilege for yourself
littlefinger	You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis
margaery	Theres no time for this
loras	Ride back to Highgarden, sister Im not running from Stannis
margaery	Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly
loras	I dont believe that You dont believe that Who gained the most from our kings death?
littlefinger	Stannis
loras	I will put a sword through his righteous face
margaery	You cant stay here
loras	He would have been a true king, a good king
littlefinger	Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?
loras	Revenge
littlefinger	I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you wont have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today Youll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground If it is justice that you want, be smart about it
margaery	You cant avenge him from the grave Bring the horses Please
margaery	He was very handsome
littlefinger	He was, Your Grace
margaery	Your Grace Calling yourself king doesnt make you one And if Renly wasnt a king, I wasnt a queen
littlefinger	Do you want to be a queen?
margaery	No I want to be the queen
cersei	Killed? By whom?
tyrion	Accounts differ Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way
cersei	Really? Whod have thought?
tyrion	Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour
cersei	Whomever did it, I say well done
tyrion	Its not what Varys says He says Renlys army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea
cersei	Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one
tyrion	And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later
cersei	Arent there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?
tyrion	Shell be safer in Dorne
cersei	Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety
tyrion	It so happens that I am Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I dont blame her at all for you
cersei	So clever Arent you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
tyrion	Schemes and plots are the same thing They are going to attack us We need to be ready
cersei	No need to concern yourself over it The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations
tyrion	May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
cersei	You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely The answer will be the same
tyrion	Its important that we talk about this
cersei	Its the kings royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors
lancel	Its wildfire
tyrion	Wildfire? You wouldnt lie to me, would you, cousin?
lancel	No
tyrion	Thats a lie right there
lancel	It is not a lie Why would I lie?
tyrion	Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him youre fucking her, I mean
lancel	Im telling you the truth
tyrion	The smart money would be on more likely
lancel	Shes making wildfire
tyrion	But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours
lancel	The Alchemists Guild is being commissioned
tyrion	I suppose theres only one way to find out
lancel	They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis ships and armies Please
tyrion	When did she tell you this?
lancel	I heard her talking with the pyromancer And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him I swear to you
tyrion	Swear to me on what?
lancel	On my life
tyrion	But I dont care about your life
lancel	In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow
tyrion	All right, all right Enough Even torturing you is boring Just get out
tyrion	Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me
lancel	Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion
bronn	It will be my pleasure
davos	Your Grace
stannis	What is it?
davos	Im sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him
stannis	Fools love a fool I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be
davos	I need to speak to you about what I saw in that cave
stannis	I thought I made it clear to you thered be no need to speak to me on this matter
davos	Your Grace, I -
stannis	Ive never known you to need to hear a thing twice
davos	And Ive never known you to hide from the truth
stannis	Youve come to lecture me on truth?
davos	Ive come to tell you that what I saw
stannis	All my brothers bannermen have come to my side Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards They wont be able to resist us now Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne
davos	Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron
stannis	Ill hear no more about it
man	Take a company of men, secure the perimeter
davos	When do we sail for Kings Landing?
stannis	As soon as Ive consolidated my troops Well make short work of the Lannisters fleet Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, well deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city
davos	And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
stannis	Thats not your concern
davos	If you take Kings Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers
stannis	I never thought Id have reason to doubt your loyalty Was I wrong?
davos	Loyal service means telling hard truths
stannis	Oh, truth again All right, whats the truth? The hard truth?
davos	Shes a foreigner preaching her foreign religion Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey
stannis	What do you believe?
davos	You won those bannermen from Renly Dont lose them to her
stannis	We set out for Kings Landing without Lady Melisandre And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay
davos	Your Grace, Im honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them The other lords wont be happy
stannis	Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I dont hang them for treason Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos
girl	Ive got it! Ive got it
man	So its that one there at the top, on the right
man	Buy my fruit, my lord Fresh fruit
tyrion	Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses What do we have?
bronn	Theres that mind of yours you keep going on about
tyrion	Well, Ive never actually been able to kill people with it
bronn	Good thing Id be out of a job What about your father?
tyrion	He hasnt sent a raven in weeks Hes very busy Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming We wont be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffreys planning on holding it
protester	Corruption
crowd	Yes
protester	We are swollen, bloated, foul Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and were surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king
tyrion	Its hard to argue with his assessment
bronn	Not after what he did to your birthday present
tyrion	The king is a lost cause Its the rest of us Im worried about now
man	A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey
tyrion	You have to admire his imagination
bronn	Hes talking about you
tyrion	What? Demon monkey?
bronn	People think youre pulling the kings strings They blame you for the citys ills
tyrion	Blame me? Im trying to save them
bronn	You dont need to convince me
tyrion	Demon monkey
man	Yeah, come on
theon	Youre the crew of the Sea Bitch? Im your commander Welcome
theon	Stop Stop! Your captain commands you to stop
black lorren	Where are we headed, Captain?
theon	The Stony Shore, to raid their villages Therell be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well
black lorren	And who decides if weve done our jobs well?
theon	I do Your captain
black lorren	I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balons balls, Captain Dont reckon Ive got much use for your ideas on how to do it Dont reckon Ive got much use for a captain at all Im thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself All I need is a ship You wouldnt know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?
theon	You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor
yara	Stop We yield
yara	Congratulations on your first command
theon	Thank you Kind of you to come see me off
yara	Oh, Im not here for you I was just on my way to Red Harbor Ive got 30 ships Theres nowhere to put them here Too narrow
theon	Youd better get out there Wouldnt want her to set sail without you
yara	That would never happen My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to This lot, though Enjoy the Stony Shore
dagmer	Come on, Ill take you out
theon	Who are you?
dagmer	Dagmer, your first mate
theon	Why arent you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh
dagmer	Theyre not gonna respect you until you prove yourself
theon	And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
dagmer	Youre not
theon	And yet thats the task my father has given me to prove that Im a true Iron Islander
dagmer	Theyre all Iron Islanders Do they do as theyre told or do they do as they like?
theon	The Stony Shores not far from Torrhens Square
dagmer	The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermens daughters What, you dont think we could take it?
theon	No, we could We could never hold it for more than a few days As soon as Winterfell got word that wed taken Torrhens Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back
and then theon	Take me to my ship
reginald	The Starks have overextended their lines Now that summers over, theyll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed
tywin	The Starks understand winter better than we ever will The cold wont beat them
amory	Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn
tywin	And Im sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords This is war, no ones content Weve underestimated the Stark boy for too long He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him And as long as he keeps winning battles, theyll keep believing he is King in the North Youve been waiting for him to fail He is not going to fail, not without our help So how do we stop him?
reginald	Weve worked through the night, my lord Perhaps wed profit from some sleep
tywin	Yes, I think you would, Reginald And because youre my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep Go, Im sure your wife must miss you
reginald	My wifes in Lannisport
tywin	Well, then youd better start riding Go, before I change my mind and send her your head
tywin	If your name wasnt Lannister, youd be scrubbing out pots in the cooks tent Go
tywin	Not wine, water Well be here for some time Girl, where are you from?
arya	Maidenpool, my lord
tywin	And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me
arya	House Mooton, my lord
tywin	And what is their sigil?
tywin	A red salmon I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that Youre a Northerner, arent you?
tywin	Good One more time, where are you from?
arya	Barrowton, my lord House Dustin Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown
tywin	And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
arya	They call him the Young Wolf
tywin	And?
arya	They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants They say he cant be killed
tywin	And do you believe them?
arya	No, my lord Anyone can be killed
tywin	Fetch that water
jaqen	A girl says nothing
jaqen	A girl keeps her mouth closed No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl
arya	I was always a girl
jaqen	And I was always aware But the girl keeps secrets It is not for a man to spoil them
arya	Youre one of them now I should have let you burn
jaqen	And you fetch water for one of them now Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
arya	I didnt have a choice
jaqen	You did I did And here we are
jaqen	A man pays his debts A man owes three
arya	Three what?
jaqen	The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl And only death may pay for life You saved me and the two I was with You stole three deaths from the Red God We have to give them back Speak three names and the man will do the rest Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and were done
arya	I can name anyone and youll kill him?
jaqen	A man has said
arya	The one who tortures everyone
jaqen	A man needs a name
arya	I dont know his name They call him the Tickler
jaqen	That is enough Go now, girl Your master is thirsty
jeor	Hes not here yet Hed have seen us, blown the horn
jon	When will he come?
jeor	The Halfhand does things in his own time
jon	My uncle told me stories about him
jeor	Most of them are true
jon	I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall
jeor	The whole winter He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came Had to wait for the thaw
jon	So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own
jeor	Well, possible for the Halfhand
sam	Beautiful, isnt it? Gilly would love it here
eddison tollett	Theres nothing more sickening than a man in love
man	About time you did something At least youll keep warm
sam	The Fist of the First Men Think of how old this place is Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men
eddison tollett	Before I die, please, stop talking
sam	Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where were standing all through the long night What do you think they were like, the First Men?
eddison tollett	Stupid Smart people dont find themselves in places like this
jon	I think they were afraid I think they came here to get away from something And I dont think it worked
grenn	Wildlings?
jon	One blast is for rangers returning Wildlings is two blasts
eddison tollett	So you got to stand there waiting, wondering One blast for friends, two for foes
sam	And three for White Walkers Its been a thousand years, but thats the only time they blow the horn three times
grenn	But if its been a thousand years, how do you know?
sam	Well I read it in a book
eddison tollett	I read it in a book
jon	Look Its Qhorin Halfhand
eddison tollett	Aye, well live another day Hurrah
haylene	Take care, my lord
tyrion	I remember reading an old sailors proverb, Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off
haylene	Oh, I have not conducted this experiment It could well be true The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow
haylene	After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power
tyrion	My companion takes issue
bronn	If I could tell you how many crazy old men Ive seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit No offense meant
haylene	Our order does not deal in pig shit The substance is fire given form And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor
bronn	To do what?
haylene	The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy
tyrion	How much do you have?
bronn	If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe youd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father
haylene	My lord, this man is insulting
bronn	I dont know if youve ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy Cause when were flinging things at Stannis, hes flinging them right back at us Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down
tyrion	My friend remains unconvinced
haylene	He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived
bronn	Well, hes not living anymore And all his pots of wildfire didnt help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks
haylene	We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so Our present count stands at 7,811 Enough to burn Stannis Baratheons fleet and armies both
bronn	This is a shit idea
tyrion	Im afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene The contents of this room could lay Kings Landing low You wont be making wildfire for my sister any longer Youll be making it for me
daenerys	Dracarys Dracarys
daenerys	Hell be able to feed himself from now on
daenerys	Let him sleep, Doreah
doreah	Yes, Khaleesi
daenerys	He loves you
irri	I rewove this part of the top And I fixed the heel on this one
daenerys	Thank you, my friend
doreah	Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say hes the wealthiest man in Qarth
irri	It is known
doreah	And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos
daenerys	The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo
irri	May he ride forever through the night lands
daenerys	Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him Men like to talk about other men when theyre happy
doreah	You would look like a real princess in Xaros
irri	Shes not a princess Shes a Khaleesi You should wear it, Khaleesi
irri	You are their guest It would be rude not to
woman	And you must visit the night market The Qartheen night market is like no night market youve ever seen
daenerys	It sounds wonderful
woman	The Meereenis think they have a night market I will take you there myself
daenerys	Please excuse me for a moment
daenerys	What are they doing?
jorah	Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold Very soft He can chop off as much as we can carry
kovarro	Or melt it Very simple
daenerys	We are his guests! You cant pry it or chop it or melt it
kovarro	Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave
daenerys	Not even when we leave
kovarro	Why not?
daenerys	Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more
daenerys	My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built
jorah	Its not the only thing Theyre quite good at killing the better men
daenerys	Thats not the kind of queen Im going to be
pyatt pree	Mother of Dragons On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you A demonstration?
pyatt pree	Take this gem Look at it Into its depths So many facets Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them Often more than once
pyatt pree	Should you grow tired of Xaros baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons
xaro	My apologies Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen It was customary for me to extend him an invitation Customs die slow deaths in Qarth
daenerys	What is the House of the Undying?
xaro	It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening It turns their lips blue and their minds soft So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic
quaithe	You watch over her
jorah	Do I know you?
quaithe	I know you Jorah Mormont of Bear Island
jorah	Who are you?
quaithe	Im no one But she is the Mother of Dragons She needs true protectors, now more than ever They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh And fire is power
brienne	It looked like Stannis
catelyn	To me it just looked like A shadow in the shape of a man
brienne	In the shape of Stannis
catelyn	We should reach my sons camp tomorrow
brienne	Will you stay there long, my lady?
catelyn	Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen After that, I will leave for Winterfell My two youngest need me Ive been away from them for far too long
brienne	I never knew my mother
catelyn	Im sorry
catelyn	My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young
brienne	Its a bloody business
catelyn	What comes after is even harder
brienne	Once youre safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?
catelyn	You mean to kill Stannis
brienne	I swore a vow
catelyn	But Stannis has a great army around him His own guards are sworn to keep him safe
catelyn	Im as good as any of them I should never have fled
catelyn	Renlys death was no fault of yours You served him bravely
brienne	I only held him that once as he was dying
catelyn	Hes gone, Brienne You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth Renlys enemies are Robbs enemies as well
brienne	I do not know your son, my lady But I could serve you, if you would have me You have courage Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I dont know, a womans kind of courage And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis

rodrik	Bran! Lord Stark Torrhens Square is under siege
luwin	Torrhens Square is barely 40 leagues from here How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
rodrik	Might be a raiding party led by the mountain Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister
bran	We have to help them
rodrik	Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather 200 decent men
luwin	Do you need so many?
bran	If we cant protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik Take the men you need
rodrik	Wont take long, my lord Southerners dont do well up here
bran	So, what does it mean?
osha	Ask your Maester Luwin Hes the one studying books all the time
bran	I did ask him Hed never heard of a three-eyed raven
osha	Must not mean anything, then
bran	Youre lying
osha	You might be a little lord, but dont you call me a liar
bran	You know what it means
osha	I never said I didnt
bran	You didnt give me an honest answer
osha	Thats not the same as being a liar
bran	Well, its not far off
osha	So, youve been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didnt dream Now whos a liar? What did you see in your dream?
osha	Something bad? Tell me, boy
bran	I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls It flooded the castle Drowned men were floating here, in the yard Ser Rodrik was one of them
osha	The sea is hundreds of miles away
bran	I know Its just a stupid dream
osha	Ive got to get these potatoes to the kitchen Otherwise theyll put me in chains again
bran	Osha The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?
osha	They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall
qhorin	There
jeor	Where?
qhorin	On that mountain
sam	I dont see very well
jon	A fire
qhorin	Theres a fire The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor
jeor	How many wildlings have joined him?
qhorin	From what we can tell, all of them Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves Theyre almost ready to make their move
jon	Where?
qhorin	Somewhere safe Somewhere south Cant just march into their midst And we cant wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us
jeor	You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
qhorin	Mance was one of us once Now hes one of them Hes going to teach them our way of doing things Theyll hit us in force and they wont run away when we hit back Theyre gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us So we need to be more like them, do things their way Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall And to do that
jeor	We need to get rid of those lookouts
qhorin	Its not a job for 400 men I need to move fast and silent Harker, Stonesnake, Borba
jon	Lord Commander, Id like to join Lord Qhorin
qhorin	Ive been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin Youre a steward, Snow, not a ranger
jon	Ive fought and killed a wight How many rangers can say that?
qhorin	Hes the one?
jeor	Aye You killed a wight You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword
qhorin	Craster? In the boys defense, thats a tough old goat
sam	I could take up Jons duties while hes gone, my lord It would be no trouble
jeor	Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward Go on
xaro	So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?
daenerys	Hes not my manservant and hes not in love with me Hes my advisor and hes my friend
xaro	Unlikely I can almost always tell what a man wants
daenerys	And what about what a woman wants?
xaro	Much more complicated You, for example, what do you want?
daenerys	To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne
xaro	Why?
daenerys	Because I promised my khalasar Id protect them and find them a safe home
xaro	You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
daenerys	I want them because theyre mine by right The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it
xaro	Ah, a conqueror
daenerys	And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
xaro	No I come from nothing I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo
daenerys	So you wanted more than you had and you took it Youre a conqueror, too Youre just less ambitious
daenerys	What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me Why?
xaro	I will show you why
xaro	The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone The hardest steel does not make a mark I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it I made the same offer to the greatest thieves They all went home empty-handed The only thing that can open this door is this key
daenerys	And behind the door?
daenerys	And it can all be mine?
xaro	All? Let us say half More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies Enough to go home
daenerys	All I have to do?
xaro	Is marry me
daenerys	That was a romantic proposal
xaro	Ive already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me I come from nothing My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses
xaro	See? I have more ambition than you thought The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name Robert Baratheon is dead
jorah	If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it
daenerys	The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another Four false kings destroying the country
jorah	To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros
daenerys	The usurper is dead
daenerys	The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other
jorah	According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
daenerys	The time to strike is now We need to find ships and an army or well spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world
jorah	Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get Theyll give you ships and soldiers and theyll own you forever Moving carefully is the hard way, but its the right way
daenerys	And if Id listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, wed all be dead by now
jorah	I know the opportunity before you seems like the last youll ever have,
daenerys	Do not speak to me like Im a child
jorah	I only want
daenerys	What do you want? Tell me
jorah	To see you on the Iron Throne
daenerys	Why?
jorah	You have a good claim A title A birthright But you have something more than that You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved Someone who can rule and should rule Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world There are times when I look at you and I still cant believe youre real
daenerys	So what would you have me do, as my advisor?
jorah	Make your own way Find your own ship You only need one The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth
daenerys	And how do I get the ship?
jorah	Ill find it for you A sound ship with a good captain
daenerys	I look forward to meeting him
jorah	Khaleesi
arya	You should stand sideface

osha	You were here the day I was taken
theon	Im the one who took you What of it?
osha	Let me serve you
theon	Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts
osha	It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens Put a spear in my hand again
theon	So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up
osha	Step aside
bran	Why?
osha	Its your dream, little lord The ocean has come to swallow this place I aint letting it drown me
theon	Youll all go about your tasks as usual And in a few days time BLACK

theon	Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes
rodrik	It grieves me youve less honor than a back alley whore You were raised here under this roof These people are your people
theon	They are not my people
rodrik	King Robb thought of you as a brother
theon	My brothers are dead They died fighting Stark men, men like you
rodrik	Aye, they died fighting a war your father started Lord Stark raised you among his own sons
theon	Among them, but not one of them I was his hostage, taken from my home
rodrik	If he were alive to see this
theon	Hes not Hes dead The Seven Kingdoms are at war And Winterfell is mine
rodrik	I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand
theon	Youve served this house faithfully, old man But keep talking and Ill
theon	Take him to the cells
lock him up dagmer	My prince You cannot let that stand He must pay
theon	Ill lock him in a cell until he rots
dagmer	No, he has to pay the iron price Theyll never respect you while he lives
theon	Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death
bran	No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded
theon	The old man couldnt keep his mouth shut
luwin	I urge you not to make a hasty decision
theon	He disrespected me in front of my men That was his decision, not mine
luwin	He is worth more to you alive than dead The Starks will pay Please, Theon, think what you do
theon	Youll address me as Prince Theon or youll be next
dagmer	Come

qhorin	There goes your pet
jon	Hes not a pet
qhorin	No, youre right, hes not You cant tame a wild thing You cant trust a wild thing
jon	Ghost is different
qhorin	So you think Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons And youll never know them Now the wildlings were looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night
jon	I thought you said you couldnt know wild things
qhorin	I said you cant They find a nice cave to hide in while the suns up and do their killing when its dark
jon	We could do the same
qhorin	No, we couldnt This is their country They know where to walk, where not to walk Ive lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didnt see till they were in it
jon	My father always said Im of the North
jon	I wasnt joking
qhorin	Look around, boy This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you You understand me?
qhorin	No, you dont Were at war Weve always been at war Its never going to end cause were not fighting an enemy Were fighting the North, and its not going anywhere The Watch has given you a great gift You only have one thing to give in return, your life

jon	I do
qhorin	Youre even dumber than you look Its just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night Make us feel like weve got a purpose Come on Weve got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us

amory	My apologies, my lord
tywin	Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses Its the one on this
tywin	My cupbearer can read better than you
tywin	To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
armory	My lord
tywin	To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants I see I overestimated you If you ever put my sons life at risk again, Ill Leave us
tywin	Put the book away, girl Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while youre about it

littlefinger	Thank you
tywin	What news from the capital?
littlefinger	I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheons camp
tywin	Ah, the late King Renly Rather a short reign Murdered by a woman, I hear
littlefinger	So they say There has been talk of other forces at work Dark forces
tywin	Here Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel
littlefinger	It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after
tywin	You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it Yes, a crisis is an opportunity What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?
littlefinger	After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers
tywin	Yes, yes, yes
littlefinger	The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings Loras wants revenge He blames Stannis for Renlys death
tywin	Wants to be queen
littlefinger	Yes, she does
tywin	House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne Against my grandson
littlefinger	They did And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated
tywin	More wine for Lord Baelish
littlefinger	If you will allow me to represent your familys interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement
tywin	The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?
littlefinger	They have
arya	Pardon, my lord
littlefinger	Its only wine
tywin	You would ride there yourself?
littlefinger	Tonight, with your leave
tywin	Ill have an answer by nightfall Thatll be all, girl

sandor	I didnt do it for you
daenerys	He shouldnt make me wait
xaro	The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth He makes everyone wait Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth
daenerys	I already have a husband
xaro	Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful
daenerys	And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery
xaro	I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery
spice king	The Mother of Dragons
xaro	Ah, here he comes
spice king	Forgive me I had terrible dreams last night Terrible dreams I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you I am sorry about all that unpleasantness The silver hair of a true Targaryen Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself
xaro	Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself
spice king	Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? Ill have them flogged in the square
daenerys	Thank you, my lord You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want
spice king	Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one So, my little princess, what is it you want?
daenerys	My birthright The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros
spice king	I fear Im no better than a servant in this regard I cannot give you what I do not have
daenerys	Im not asking you for the kingdoms Im asking you for ships
spice king	I need to cross the Narrow Sea I need my ships as well I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another
daenerys	Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne
spice king	Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
daenerys	My father sat there, before he was murdered
spice king	But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say take the Iron Throne ?
daenerys	I didnt come here to argue grammar
spice king	Of course not You came to take my ships So let me explain my position, little princess Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors I make my living by trade And I judge every trade on its merits You ask for ships You say I shall be repaid triple I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms Do you have an army?
daenerys	Not yet
spice king	You do not have an army Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
daenerys	There are many there that support my claim
spice king	When were you there last?
daenerys	I left when I was a baby
spice king	So, in truth, you have no allies
daenerys	The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return
spice king	Ah Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams Now if youll pardon me
daenerys	Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, weve met
spice king	A shrewd man
daenerys	For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons
daenerys	Do you understand? Im no ordinary woman My dreams come true
spice king	I admire your passion But in business, I trust in logic, not passion Im sorry, little princess
daenerys	I am not your little princess I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine With fire and blood, I will take it
spice king	Yes, my lady, but not with my ships , catching her in the act
tywin	Who taught you to read?
arya	My father, my lord
tywin	Hmm I taught my son Jaime to read The maester came to me one day, told me he wasnt learning He couldnt make sense of the letters He reversed them in his head The maester said hed heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned He hated me for it, for a time For a long time But he learned Hmm Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?

robb	Lady Talisa
talisa	Your Grace
robb	Im not sure Im a lady
talisa	Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me
robb	Its hard to keep all the rules straight But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady Unless shes a queen or a princess I could find someone who knows
talisa	Why are you so sure Im of noble birth?
robb	Because its obvious
talisa	What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop?
robb	Id call you a liar
talisa	Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty
talisa	I always thought I was a brilliant liar
robb	Better at amputations, Im afraid
robb	Quite a pretty spot
talisa	Will we be here long?
robb	I couldnt really discuss troop movements with you
talisa	Im not a spy
robb	Of course, a spy would deny being a spy
talisa	Youre right Youve found me out Im writing a letter to the Lannisters The young wolf is on the move Perhaps youd join me If youve got time, of course, for
well catelyn	Robb
robb	Mother Mother, this is Lady Talisa Shes been helping with the wounded Shes been very helpful
catelyin	Lady Talisa
talisa	Lady Stark
catelyn	Lady Talisa
talisa	Maegyr
catelyn	Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name
talisa	An uncommon name here An old name in Volantis Excuse me, my lady Your Grace
robb	Ive missed you
catelyn	Yes, you look positively forlorn
robb	You surprised me, thats all I didnt think Id see you today
catelyn	I wish that you were free to follow your heart
robb	I know
catelyn	You have inherited your fathers responsibilities Im afraid they come at a cost You are promised to another
robb	I know
catelyn	A debt that must be paid
robb	I havent forgotten
roose	Your Grace My lady News from Winterfell
ygritte	Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go
jon	Well stop here Too dark to go any farther today
ygritte	Here? Theres no shelter here
jon	Theres no shelter anywhere
ygritte	There is if you know where to look The cold could kill us both If you light a fire
jon	No fire
ygritte	But a fire is
jon	No fire
ygritte	Have it your way
ygritte	Well stay warmer if we stay close
ygritte	Bet you freeze to death before I do Bet your life
ygritte	Think theyre out looking for you?
jon	Yes
ygritte	Think theyll find you?
jon	Yes
ygritte	Youre brave Stupid, but brave
jon	We start again at first light Get some sleep
jon	Stop moving
ygritte	Im just trying to get comfortable
jon	Stop it
jon	Youre still moving
ygritte	Was I? I didnt notice that time
robb	This cannot be true
roose	Weve had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort Im afraid it is true
robb	Why?
why would theon roose	Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores
robb	My brothers?
roose	Weve heard nothing of them But Rodrik Cassel is dead
catelyn	I told you, never trust a Greyjoy
robb	I must go north at once
roose	Theres still a war to win, Your Grace
robb	How can I call myself king if I cant hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I cant
roose	You are a king And that means you dont have to do everything yourself
catelyn	Let me go and talk to Theon
robb	There will be no talk He will die for this
roose	Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon We have the Lannisters on the run If you march all the way back north now, youll lose what you gained My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theons head
robb	Tell your son Bran and Rickons safety is paramount And Theon, I want him brought to me alive I want to look him in the eye and ask him why And then Ill take his head myself
theon	Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
osha	Im no liar
theon	All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone
osha	I done what I had to do to stay alive I hate the Starks as well as you do Let me serve you, my lord
theon	How? And dont tell me to put a spear in your hand
osha	There are other ways to serve, my lord
theon	Im a prince now, and youd do well
ahsa	There are other ways to serve, my prince
theon	Like what?
osha	We know things, the free people
theon	You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
osha	Other things
osha	Savage things
theon	Wait outside
theon	I always wondered what you had under there
osha	It comes at a price
theon	Im not killing you Thats your price
osha	I already had that
theon	What do you want then, other than your miserable life?
ahsa	What all free people want My freedom
theon	Well, you shall have it, then But only if you serve me well
sansa	Ow
shae	Shh Its not deep
sansa	I thought they were going to kill me
shae	They thought so, too
sansa	He hated me, the man who hit me I saw it in his eyes Hated me He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me
shae	Of course he did
sansa	Why? Why would a stranger
shae	You are everything he will never have Your horse eats better than his children It doesnt matter now Hes dead
sansa	I would have given them bread if I had it I hate the king more than any of them
shae	Dont say these things If the wrong people hear you
sansa	But youre not the wrong people
shae	Dont trust anybody Life is safer that way
guard	And where are you going?
osha	I have something for you from Prince Theon
guard	What?
osha	Me He says Im to make the rounds And keep you warm
daenerys	The Spice King refuses me because Im a bad investment The Silk King wont support me because of his business with the Lannisters Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
xaro	When I came to this city, I had nothing Truly nothing I slept by the docks And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat If not, I dreamed of food Today, I am the richest man in Qarth Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn And here I am, with no regrets
xaro	Bar the gates Ring the bells Slowly, Khaleesi
daenerys	W h e r e a r e t h e y ? W h e r e a r e m y d r a g o n s ?
theon	A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy cant walk, but somehow he slipped past you?
black lorren	The giant must have took him
theon	The giant? Hodor? Oh, thats all right, then You let a halfwit escape with a cripple And Rickon, too? The little one?
black lorren	Gone, along with the wildling woman The one you were fucking
theon	Right Get the horses and the hounds
man	Come on, find the scent Where they going?
dagmer	Halt
theon	Enjoying your first hunt?
luwin	So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord
theon	With hunting, theres blood at the end
luwin	Theyre little boys
theon	I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here So I kept my word I never ran away If I find them soon enough, I wont hurt them Well, Ill hurt them, but I wont kill them
luwin	Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead
theon	They have no value to me missing
luwin	Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now
theon	Robbs in the Riverlands My sisters in Deepwood Motte Shell get here long before they do And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000
man	We have a scent
theon	The hounds have the scent Come, Maester, dont look so grim Its all just a game
osha	We should have took more food
bran	We couldnt risk going to the kitchens
osha	Those people all love you They would have given you whatever you needed
bran	And if Theon found out, hed hang them
osha	The boy cant survive on walnuts
rickon	Im fine
osha	Weve been walking since before sunrise Eve will tire
hodor	Hodor
osha	Even you, sweet giant
hodor	Hodor
bran	Wait, I know that farm I sent those two Winterfell orphans there
rickon	Jack and Billy Theyll give us some food
bran	We cant risk it If Theon tracks us here, hell torture them until he finds out where we are
rikon	Billy climbs a tree better than anyone
osha	Youve never seen me climb a tree, little man
bran	Theyll be after us with hounds
osha	We got a good start on them, but we cant outrun hounds forever
ygritte	Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
ygritte	Whats the matter? Cant be the first time you pressed your bone against a womans arse
jon	Lets move
ygritte	It is the first time How old are you, boy?
jon	Im a man of the Nights Watch
ygritte	Youre a boy whos never been with a girl Dont your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets
jon	Dont call them that
ygritte	What, stones? Or bone?
jon	Neither Both
jon	Move
ygritte	I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you dont use them Of course, maybe thats just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them As if Id feel sorry for them Are there no girl crows?
jon	There are no women of the Nights Watch, no
ygritte	So the lads just do it with each other?
jon	No
ygritte	Never?
jon	Never We swore an oath
ygritte	You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder youre all so miserable
jon	Would you please shut up?
ygritte	Would you please shut up? You think youre better than me, crow Im a free woman
jon	Youre a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but Im a free woman
jon	If youre my prisoner, youre not a free woman Thats what prisoner means
ygritte	And you think youre free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl
jon	It was my choice to say the words
ygritte	So you dont like girls?
jon	Of course I like girls But you chose never to touch them
jon	Thats the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Nights Watch
ygritte	So instead of getting naked with a girl, youd prefer to invade our lands
jon	Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy
ygritte	Yheyre not your lands! Weve been here the whole time You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours
jon	My father was Ned Stark I have the blood of the First Men My ancestors lived here, same as yours
ygritte	So why are you fighting us?
man	Go on Now I want you to tell me what happened Come on, this way Come on, speak up Speak up
tywin	Wolfsbane A rare substance This is no common assassin
mountian	We hanged 20 men last night
tywin	I dont care if you hanged 100 A man tried to kill me I want his name and I want his head
mountain	We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners
tywin	Pretentious name for a band of outlaws We cant allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity We look like fools and they look like heroes Thats how kings fall I want them dead, every one
mountain	Killing them isnt the problem Its finding them Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence
twyin	Burn the villages, burn the farms Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side
tywin	Mmm Is that mutton?
arya	Yes, my lord
tywin	Dont like mutton
arya	Ill bring something else
tywin	Leave it Are you hungry?
arya	No
tywin	Of course you are Eat
arya	Ill eat in the kitchen later
tywin	Its bad manners to refuse a lords offer Sit Eat
tywin	Youre small for your age I suppose youve been underfed your whole life
arya	I eat a lot I just dont grow
tywin	Mmm This will be my last war Win or lose
arya	Have you ever lost before?
tywin	Do you think Id be in my position if I had lost a war?
tywin	But this is the one Ill be remembered for The War of Five Kings, theyre calling it My legacy will be determined in the coming months
tywin	Do you know what legacy means? Its what you pass down to your children and your childrens children Its what remains of you when youre gone Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy The greatest fortress ever built The tallest towers, the strongest walls The Great Hall had 35 hearths Thirty-five Can you imagine? Look at it now A blasted ruin Do you know what happened?
arya	Dragons?
tywin	Yes Dragons happened
tywin	Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmm-mmm Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls Aegon Targaryen changed the rules Thats why every child alive still knows his name
arya	Aegon and his sisters
tywin	Mmm?
arya	It wasnt just Aegon riding his dragon It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too
tywin	Correct A student of history, are you?
arya	Rhaenys rode Meraxes Visenya rode Vhagar
tywin	Im sure I knew that when I was a boy
arya	Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister
tywin	Hmm Shes a heroine of yours, I take it?
tywin	Arent most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
arya	Most girls are idiots
tywin	You remind me of my daughter Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
arya	From my father
tywin	He was a well-read stonemason Cant say Ive ever met a literate stonemason
arya	Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?
tywin	Careful now, girl I enjoy you, but be careful Take that back to the kitchen Eat what you want
tywin	And, girl
tywin	Mlord
tywin	Lowborn girls say mlord, not my lord If youre going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly
arya	My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord She taught me how to speak proper Properly
tywin	Youre too smart for your own good Has anyone told you that?
arya	Yes
tywin	Go on
sansa	I beg pardon, ser I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me You were so brave
sandor	Brave? A dog doesnt need courage to chase off rats
sansa	Does it give you joy to scare people?
sandor	No, it gives me joy to kill people
sandor	Spare me You cant tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man
sansa	It was his duty He never liked it
sandor	Is that what he told you? He lied Killing is the sweetest thing there is
sansa	Why are you always so hateful?
sandor	Youll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when youre queen and Im all that stands between you and your beloved king
xaro	Ive demanded a meeting of the Thirteen One of them did this or knows who did
daenerys	You are one of the Thirteen
xaro	If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them They mean nothing to me on their own
daenerys	Nothing? Theyre more valuable than anything in the world
xaro	Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back
daenerys	There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?
xaro	I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city A man is what others say he is and no more If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof
daenerys	But it did happen under your roof
xaro	Khaleesi, many times in my life
daenerys	I dont care where youve been
ygritte	You think were savages because we dont live in stone castles We cant make steel as good as yours, its true, but Were free If someone tried to tell us we couldnt lie down as man and woman, wed shove a spear up his arse We dont go serving some shit king whos only king because his father was
jon	No No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall
ygritte	We chose Mance Rayder to lead us He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free You could be free, too You dont need to live your whole life taking commands from old men Wake up when you want to wake up I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night
ygritte	Youre a pretty lad The girls would claw each others eyes out to get naked with you
jon	Walk
ygritte	I could teach you how to do it
jon	I know how to do it
ygritte	You know nothing, Jon Snow
robb	And what did she say?
alton	She admired your spirit, Your Grace
robb	And what then?
she robb	If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, wed all hang
alton	She tore the paper in half, Your Grace
robb	Youve acted with honor I thank you for it Lord Karstark, see that Ser Altons pen is clean, and give him a hot supper
rickard kar	Ser Altons pen is occupied, Your Grace The prisoners from the Yellow Fork
roose	Too many prisoners
robb	Is there room for Ser Alton?
rickard kar	Does he need to lie down?
robb	Have the men build him a new pen Put him in with the Kingslayer for now Have your boy watch over them
rickard kar	Torrhen
robb	That will be all
talisa	Your Grace A minute of your time?
talisa	Ive been treating your wounded men
robb	And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning
talisa	Theyre not my enemies
robb	Thats what I tell my bannermen
talisa	Ive already run through the supplies I brought with me Some are easily replaced Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses But some are not I need silk for stitching I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark Mostly I need milk of the poppy You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over
robb	If you need help finding these
talisa	I know where to find them Im sorry, I shouldnt interrupt you
robb	Continue, my lady
talisa	Youre riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
robb	Yes
talisa	The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need
robb	I expect he will
talisa	If I could write a list
robb	Come with me to the Crag
talisa	I dont think that will be
robb	Let the maester show you his stores I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men
woman	Children, come inside, quick Come on
child	Hurry up
man	Cant find anything, ser Theyve lost the scent
theon	Try again
man	Weve circled this farmhouse twice Theres no sign of them
luwin	We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord
theon	Im looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldnt do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again Ill beat them until they do Ill whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand And once Ive got them, the pampered little shits Its better to be cruel than weak
man	Prince Theon
theon	Where are they?
winterfell shepherd	Who, mlord?
theon	The Stark boys Where are they?
winterfell shepherd	I dont know I seen no one
theon	Think harder
winterfell shepherd	I swear, mlord I dont know
dagmer	My lord, over here I think Ive found what were looking for
dagmer	Send the old man home
theon	Go back to Winterfell Take him back
luwin	Theon, dont do this
daenerys	You came back
jorah	As soon as I heard Do you know anything?
daenerys	Irri is dead
jorah	I know She was a good
daenerys	Shes dead She died alone She died for me and I couldnt protect her
jorah	Doreah?
daenerys	We cant find her She must be dead, too I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse
jorah	I should have been here
daenerys	You went to find me a ship
jorah	My place is by your side I shouldnt have left you alone with these people
daenerys	These people ?
jorah	They are not to be trusted
daenerys	And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse
jorah	Your people are in Westeros
daenerys	The people in Westeros dont know Im alive
jorah	They will soon enough
daenerys	And then what? Theyll pray for my return? Theyll wave dragon banners and shout my name? Thats what my brother believed and he was a fool
daenerys	You are not your brother
jorah	Trust me, Khaleesi
daenerys	There it is Trust me And its you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I dont need trust any longer I dont want it and I dont have room for it
jorah	You are too young to be so
daenerys	And you are too familiar
jorah	Forgive me, Khaleesi No one can survive in this world without help No one Let me help you, please Tell me how
daenerys	Find my dragons
ygritte	How long till we get back to your crows?
jon	Were close
ygritte	What, a day? A half-day? You dont know, do you? Do you even know where they are?
jon	Were close
ygritte	What do you think theyll say when they hear about you and me?
jon	Nothing happened between you and me
ygritte	I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club I can show you the bruise on me tailbone And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like And I didnt want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined The shame of it Now I can never marry a perfumed lord What will me poor savage father say?
jon	Turn back around
ygritte	And I thought that we were done, but he said, Turn back around Ill tell you what, Jon Snow Since its gonna be your word against mine, and since you cant talk about it without blushing, we may as well just
jon	What, right here in the muck?
ygritte	Ill keep you warm enough
ygritte	Are you that afraid of it?
jon	Thats enough
ygritte	Its nice and wet and warm
jon	Enough
ygritte	It dont have teeth
ygritte	All right! All right Gods, youre dull
ygritte	Should have took me while you had the chance
sansa	No, no
sansa	No Oh, no
shae	Its all right Give me that
sansa	If the Queen sees, I can have Joffreys children now
shae	Help me flip it over
shae	Where are you going?
handmaiden	To tell Her Grace
shae	Youll say nothing to anyone Do you understand?
cersei	Your mother might have prepared you You flowered, my dear No more
sansa	My mother told me, but I thought it would be different
cersei	In what way?
sansa	I thought it would be less Less messy
cersei	Wait until you birth a child
cersei	Youre a woman now Do you have any idea what that means?
sansa	Im fit to bear children for the king?
cersei	A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen
cersei	Joffrey has always been difficult Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world You cannot imagine the pain I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood
sansa	His Grace was not with you?
cersei	Robert was hunting That was his custom Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stags head, and I would present him with a baby Not that I wanted him there, mind you I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother When they told Jaime he wasnt allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out Joffrey will show you no such devotion
cersei	You may never love the king, but you will love his children
sansa	I love His Grace with all my heart
cersei	Thats so very touching to hear Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day The more people you love, the weaker you are Youll do things for them that you know you shouldnt do Youll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe Love no one but your children On that front, a mother has no choice
sansa	But shouldnt I love Joffrey, Your Grace?
cersei	You can try, little dove
cersei	Who did you say your mother was again?
alton	Cinda Lannister
jaime	Is she the fat one?
alton	Well, perhaps shes gotten a little larger than she
jaime	No, no Theres only one fat Lannister If she was your mother, youd know it
alton	I squired for you once, you know
jaime	When?
alton	The tournament, the day of Willem Freys wedding
jaime	I went to Willem Freys wedding?
alton	You did Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up
jaime	He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds What was his name?
alton	Bryan
jaime	Poor lad That was my brothers doing, I seem to recall I remember you Youd never squired for anyone before
alton	Thats right I ran up and volunteered Let me, my lord Let me My father was furious Afraid Id embarrass our family in front of the Family
jaime	You didnt, though
alton	You really remember?
jaime	You knew when you were needed and when to go away Its a rare talent Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them
alton	When I think back to that day
guard	Shh
jaime	You were saying?
alton	I Never mind Its embarrassing
jaime	More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
alton	I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me Ill remember it all until I die That was the best day of my life And I remember being on the field after it was over All the competitors were done I was the last one out there And I couldnt leave I couldnt bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride And I couldnt bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about
jaime	I understand completely
alton	How could you? Sorry, I I didnt mean to doubt you
jaime	Its just that I I was 16 once I also had to replace someones squire on short notice
alton	Which knight was it?
jaime	Barristan Selmy The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws Before your time
alton	What was he like?
jaime	He was A painter A painter who only used red I couldnt imagine being able to fight like that, not back then And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect I dont need to explain how that felt, not to you
alton	Its hard to put into words
jaime	Its like stepping into a dream youve been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life
alton	Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison
alton	Did you squire for him again?
jaime	No I didnt have your gift He couldnt take a step without stepping on me I was awful, a complete liability Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire
jaime	Its a good thing I am who I am Id have been useless at anything else Im not well-suited for imprisonment Shocking, I know Some men are Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end Not me, though My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint
alton	And have you thought about
jaime	Of course Every day
alton	And?
jaime	Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently The Starks are very careful
jaime	But there is a way, I think It wasnt possible until now
alton	What is it?
jaime	Its actually quite simple
alton	Well, let me help you
jaime	Youll only have to do one thing
alton	Tell me
jaime	Youll have to die
quaith	Jorah the Andal This man must sail past old Valyria All who travel too close to the doom must have protection
jorah	I didnt come here for lessons
quaith	No, you came for the dragons
jorah	You have them? Where are they?
quaith	Draw your sword See what your steel is worth You want to please the Mother of Dragons
quaith	You love her
jorah	Where are the dragons?
quaith	Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?
quaith	Will you betray her again?
jorah	Never
quaith	The thief you seek is with her now
spice king	I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief
xaro	No one is calling you a thief Who is she to accuse us?
daenerys	Please, theyre my children Im begging you
silk king	Begging us? It wasnt very long ago you were threatening us
daenerys	Without me, the dragons will die
spice king	It will be for the best Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear If I knew where they were, I would not tell you
pyat pree	You are cruel, my friend The Mother of Dragons is in the right She must be reunited with her babies I will help you, Khaleesi
daenerys	How?
pyatt pree	I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them
daenerys	You have my dragons?
pyatt pree	When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth He procured them for me
daenerys	But there is no King of Qarth
xaro	There is now That was the other half of the arrangement
xaro	You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me
spice king	Your ambition is an inspiration But like all upstarts, you overreach Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king
xaro	An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise
pyatt pree	The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever
pyatt pree	A mother should be with her children
pyatt pree	Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying Come see them
jacks	Lady Stark
brienne	No farther
jacks	Keep your hands off me, woman
brienne	Dont enter without an invitation, man
jacks	Forgive me Lady Stark
catelyn	What is it?
jacks	They caught the Kingslayer
man	Kingslayer
man	Kill the fucking Kingslayer
man	Hang him
man	Hang him
man	Youll die today
man	Justice for the Karstark
man	Gut him
rickard kar	Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death
catelyn	Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner
rickard	This monster killed my son
catelyn	And crippled mine He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here
rickard kar	I will have his head And if you try and stop me
catelyn	You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark I am the mother of your king
rickard kar	And where is our king now?
robb	You know very well
rickard kar	He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate He brought that foreign bitch with him
catelyn	How dare you
brienne	Threatening my lady is an act of treason
rickard kar	Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
catelyn	I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down
rickard kar	When your son returns, I will demand this murderers head
catelyn	Wise men do not make demands of kings
rickard kar	Fathers who love their sons do I will have his head
jaime	Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark I would have come to your defense
but catelyn	Take him to the stockades Bind him with every chain you can find
jaime	Youve become a real she-wolf in your later years Theres not much fish left in you
catelyn	And gag him
tyrion	Since when do you light your own candles?
cersei	Since I decided that I cant stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant
cersei	How many times can you read one raven scroll?
tyrion	Stannis Baratheons fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships
cersei	More than we have
tyrion	Yes, thats more than we have Hell be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind
cersei	We have strong, high walls Well rain fire down on them from above
tyrion	Rain fire on them from above Youre quoting Father, arent you?
cersei	Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesnt he?
tyrion	Call it tactics, not strategy But, yes, he does have a good mind for it The best mind, some would say Sadly, hes not here Its just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
cersei	Im sure youll make a point eventually
tyrion	He needs to start acting like a king This war you started is coming to our doorstep And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
cersei	Im not the one giving the boy whores to abuse
tyrion	I thought the girls might help him
cersei	Did you?
tyrion	I was wrong If we cant control him
cersei	Do you think I havent tried? He doesnt listen to me
tyrion	Its hard to put a leash on a dog once youve put a crown on its head
cersei	I always hoped hed be like Jaime He looks like him In a certain light
tyrion	The boy is more Robert than Jaime
cersei	Robert was a drunken fool, but he didnt enjoy cruelty Sometimes I wonder What? If this is the price for what weve done, for our sins
tyrion	Sins?
cersei	The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know Thats what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt Its what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me Half the Targaryens went mad, didnt they? Whats the saying? Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin
tyrion	Youve beaten the odds Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them
man	Then why wait?
man	Were sworn to the king
man	Theres not a king
man	Thats treason
man	So is saving Lannisters, yeah?
man	Back off, you
man	No, I wont
brienne	Your son returns at dawn, my lady?
catelyn	So they say
brienne	ingslayer wont last the night The more they drink, the angrier theyll get And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?
catelyn	Come
catelyn	I need to be alone with him
guard	My lady
our orders catelyn	Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him
jaime	Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe its my last night in this world Is that a woman?
catelyn	Do you hear them out there? They want your head
jaime	Old Lord Karstark doesnt seem to like me
catelyn	You strangled his son with your chains
jaime	Oh Oh Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way Any knight would have done the same
catelyn	You are no knight You have forsaken every vow you ever took
jaime	So many vows They make you swear and swear Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? Its too much No matter what you do, youre forsaking one vow or another Where did you find this beast?
catelyn	She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer
jaime	Kingslayer What a king he was Heres to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back
catelyn	You are a man without honor
jaime	Do you know, Ive never been with any woman but Cersei So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned What was the name of that bastard he fathered?
catelyn	Brienne
jaime	No, that wasnt it Snow, a bastard from the North Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whores baby, did you pretend to love it? No Youre not very good at pretending Youre an honest woman You hated that boy, didnt you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman
catelyn	Your sword
theon	I told you what would happen All of you I told you what would happen if you served me loyally And what would happen if you did not
luwin	What are you doing? What have you done?
theon	If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question
luwin	No
man	Riders approaching
mar	Open the gate
yara	Why, its the Prince of Winterfell
theon	Envy isnt attractive
yara	What envy?
theon	You should be proud of your brothers achievement I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men
yara	Youre a great warrior I saw the bodies above your gates Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?
theon	I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery
yara	You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
theon	Before I had to kill them, I treated them
yara	You seized their home, as is your right Were ironborn, we take what we need
theon	Exactly
yara	Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away Is that treachery? Id call it bravery
theon	They made me a promise
yara	Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
theon	Dont call me
yara	A cunt A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell You know how valuable those boys were?
theon	If I hadnt killed them, the Northerners would think me weak
yara	You are weak And youre stupid
theon	Im warning you
yara	Go on, then Warn me
theon	You havent brought enough men How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
yara	Youre not Ive come to bring you home Father wants a word
theon	Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North
yara	Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea Were islanders, baby brother Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships And now that youve decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged When Robb Stark finds out
theon	He wont find out Weve killed all the ravens We have all the horses Ive taken Winterfell And I will keep Winterfell
yara	Leave us
yara	Theon, youre my blood We both loved our mother We both endured our father Come home with me Dont die here alone
theon	I dont intend to die
yara	You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping And one night, you just wouldnt shut up, screaming like a dying pig I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you I wanted to strangle you And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming You smiled at me Dont die so far from the sea
ygritte	Ive brought you a present, Lord of Bones
lord of bones	I already got one crow Dont need two
ygritte	Mance will want to question this one Knows all about where the crows are and what theyre planning
lord of bones	The Halfhand knows more This one is just a little boy Gut him
ygritte	He could have killed me half a dozen times
lord of bones	And now he wishes he did Gut him
ygritte	Hes a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Starks son Mance will want him
lord of bones	What does Mance want with a dead mans bastard?
ygritte	I dont know I think hell want to decide for himself
lord of bones	He runs, Ill chop his balls off
ygritte	He runs, Ill do it meself
ygritte	Were even now, Jon Snow
jon	I couldnt do it I had the sword on her neck
i just couldnt qhorin	I know
jon	The others?
qhorin	When you didnt come back, we went looking for you We found your tracks fast enough But they found us before we found you
jon	They died because of me
qhorin	See that it wasnt for nothing
wildling	All right, up, lad
wildling	Come on, on your feet, now Move it
talisa	Is she beautiful?
robb	Ive never met her
talisa	Whats her name?
robb	Frey, I suppose I dont know her first name
talisa	Im sure youll be very happy
talisa	And youre marrying her for a bridge?
robb	An important bridge
talisa	Ah
robb	It was before they killed my father I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge
talisa	When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father
robb	He was the best man I ever met I know children always think that about their fathers
but talisa	Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me
robb	He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect The soldiers you order into battle He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night I didnt believe him I asked him, How can a man be brave if hes afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave, he told me
talisa	I wish I could have met him
robb	He would have liked you
talisa	Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors
robb	He didnt care much about gold or glory
talisa	And you? You think Im fighting this war so theyll sing songs about me? I want to go home I want the men following me to go home
talisa	Then why dont you?
robb	Because well never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated And because I believe in justice
talisa	Chopping off Joffreys head, you mean
robb	That would be a start
rider	Your Grace, milady ingslayer, he escaped in the night
robb	How? How?
robb	Tell me this isnt true
robb	Why?
catelyn	For the girls
robb	You betrayed me
robb robb	No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway
catelyn	Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell Sansa and Arya are captives in Kings Landing I have five children, and only one of them is free
rickard kar	I lost one son fighting by your sons side I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell
catelyn	I grieve for your sons, my lord
rickard kar	I dont want your grief I want my vengeance And you stole it from me
catelyn	Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to Kings Landing may buy life for mine
robb	Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool Youve weakened our position Youve brought discord into our camp And you did it all behind my back Make sure shes guarded day and night
catelyn	Robb How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
soldier	Forty, Your Grace
robb	Send another 40 with our fastest horses
catelyn	Robb
jaime	Damn
jaime	Youre much uglier in daylight Whats your name? Im Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin
jaime	A captive knight has a right to know his captors identity
brienne	Brienne of Tarth
jaime	Tarth, Tarth, Tarth Crescent moons and starbursts Lord Selwyn Tarth Your father Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? Its a long way to Kings Landing Might as well get to know one another
jaime	Have you known many men? I suppose not Women? Horses? Ah
jaime	I didnt mean to give offense, my lady Forgive me
brinenne	Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer
jaime	Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
brinenne	Youve harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent
jaime	Has anyone ever told you youre as boring as you are ugly?
brinenne	You will not provoke me to anger
jaime	I already have Look at you Youre ready to chop my head off Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
brinenne	Ive never seen you fight
jaime	The answer is no There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me Youre not one of them
brienne	All my life men like you have sneered at me And all my life Ive been knocking men like you into the dust
jaime	If youre so confident, unlock my chains Lets see what happens
brinenne	Do you take me for an idiot? In
jaime	I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon Woman of honor Was I wrong? Youre afraid
brinenne	Maybe one day well find out, Kingslayer
kevan	Kings Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force Its not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety
tyrion	To create strife between my sister and me
varys	Where before there was nothing but love Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sisters orders If it werent for your squires bravery, youd be a dead man
tyrion	Pod
podrick	Yes, my lord?
tyrion	Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
podrick	No, my lord
tyrion	Youre a good lad Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times
varys	Im afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister It varies from cloak to cloak
tyrion	Then my hill tribesmen
varys	Have gone home Your father paid them quite handsomely Im afraid we wont be seeing each other for some time, my lord
tyrion	Dont want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends
varys	We are Podrick, would you mind?
varys	There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat The king wont give you any honors, the histories wont mention you, but we will not forget
varys	Come along now, Podrick

jaqen	If you would learn, you must come with me
arya	Where?
jaqen	Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos
arya	My dancing master was from Braavos
jaqen	To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely The girl has many names on her lips Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound Names to offer up to the Red God She could offer them all one by one
arya	I want to But I cant I need to find my brother and mother And my sister I need to find her, too

arya	Could it buy a horse?
jaqen	It is not meant for the buying of horses
arya	Then what good is it?
jaqen	If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, Valar Morghulis
arya	Valar Morghulis
arya	Please dont go, Jaqen
jaqen	Jaqen is dead Say it again Valar Morghulis
arya	Valar Morghulis

luwin	Do it quickly
drogo	Moon of my life
daenerys	This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just dont know it yet Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands
drogo	Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you
daenerys	That sounds like something you would do
drogo	Or maybe it is a dream Your dream, my dream I do not know These are questions for wise men with skinny arms
drogo	You are the moon of my life That is all I know and all I need to know
drogo	And if this is a dream I will kill the man who tries to wake me

mance	No, I dont think so I think what you want most of all is to be a hero Ill ask you one last time why do you want to join us?
jon	We stopped at Crasters Keep on the way north I saw.
mance	You saw what?
jon	I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods I saw what took it
mance	Youre telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
jon	Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them I want to fight for the side that fights for the living Did I come to the right place?
mance	Well need to find you a new cloak
bronn	What if you took off that bit there?
whore	Dont you want to leave something to the imagination?
bronn	Trouble is, Ive never had much imagination
whore	I want you to take it off
whore	Mouth
podrick	Ser Bronn Ser Bronn
bronn	I didnt hear that
podrick	Apologies, ser
bronn	Back away Keep backing away till youre outside this establishment Then back away some more
podrick	Lord Tyrion sent me
bronn	I will murder you, boy
podrick	He said it was a matter of life and death
tyrion	Pod?
cersei	Its your sister The queen
tyrion	What are they doing here?
cersei	Protecting me, I assume Will you let me in?
tyrion	No, I dont think so
cersei	If I wanted to kill you, do you think Id let a wooden door stop me?
tyrion	They stay outside
cersei	Im not afraid of you, little brother
tyrion	Why are you here?
cersei	I wanted to see your face They said youd lost your nose, but its not as gruesome as all that
tyrion	The man who cut me lost more than his nose
cersei	I should hope so The rebels came for Joffreys head, they lost their own Thanks to Father
tyrion	Thanks to Father Of course, it wasnt a rebel who tried to kill me
cersei	No? Curious Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand But then I dont suppose you need much room
tyrion	Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees
cersei	Youre meeting Father today?
tyrion	How do you know that?
cersei	Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two Father told me What do you want from him?
tyrion	What do I want from him? Hes my father Do I need to want something? Im sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy Yet he hasnt come to visit once since arriving in Kings Landing I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came
cersei	Youre going to make me cry
tyrion	Why do you care what I want from him?
cersei	Because youve slandered me to Father before
tyrion	Slandered? When?
cersei	You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock
tyrion	You did have your guards beat her A girl of nine, I believe
cersei	I was nine, too
tyrion	She lost an eye, if I remember correctly
cersei	If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again
tyrion	Its not slander if its true
cersei	And whats this truth you plan on telling him today?
tyrion	Why are you so nervous about what Im going to say to Father?
cersei	Because youre a liar I expect youll tell lies about me, about Joffrey
tyrion	Any lies in particular?
cersei	Youre a clever man, but youre not half as clever as you think you are
tyrion	Still makes me more clever than you
bronn	Oh, look at these two shining warriors Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares
meryn trant	Ser Meryn Trant
bronn	Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
meryn trant	Youre no knight
bronn	Pod
podrick	Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself
meryn trant	Youre an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more
bronn	Thats exactly who I am And youre a grub in fancy armor whos better at beating little girls than fighting men Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion
meryn trant	You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand
bronn	As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me
tyrion	A number of people in this city want to kill me Youre here to protect me
bronn	Ive been doing that for a while now
tyrion	Do you grow bored protecting me?
bronn	I grow poor protecting you
tyrion	Poor? Poor? Under my patronage youve become a knight, youve served as Commander of the City Watch
bronn	Briefly
tyrion	Im sure you filled your pockets
bronn	And now my pockets are empty Youve given me a taste for the finer things And if you want me to carry on protecting you, youll need to pay more
tyrion	I thought we were friends
bronn	We are But Im a sellsword I sell my sword I dont loan it out to friends as a favor
tyrion	How much?
bronn	Double
tyrion	Double?
bronn	Im a knight now Knights are worth double
tyrion	I dont even know how much Im paying you now
bronn	Which means you can afford it
blackwater bay davos	Here Here! Help me
man	Who are you?
davos	I was in the battle at Blackwater I was a captain and a knight
man	Aye, ser, and serving which king?
davos	The one true king of Westeros Stannis Baratheon
salladhor	I thought you were dead Everyone thought you were dead And your son?
salladhor	He may have swam ashore as you did
davos	No, the wildfire took him I saw it
salladhor	Im so sorry, my friend I, too, have lost a son There is nothing worse in this world But, Davos, you were a good father
davos	If I was a good father, hed still be here Stannis lives?
salladhor	He licks his wounds at Dragonstone
davos	Will you take me there?
salladhor	There is nothing for me at Dragonstone
davos	This war is not over
salladhor	Not for you, maybe But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over
davos	Were both sworn to King Stannis
salladhor	I am sworn to no man I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory I delivered the ships
davos	Stannis never gives up Never Now he will regroup .
salladhor	Hes a broken man His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay They say he sees no one not his generals, not even his wife Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive
davos	What?
salladhor	They built a great fire when Stannis returned All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness They say she sang to them as they burned
salladhor	Im a pirate
davos	Youre a smuggler
salladhor	Servants of darkness Im thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid
davos	Take me back there, please
salladhor	You cannot turn Stannis against her
davos	Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out
salladhor	You could try If you fail, they will burn you If you succeed, theyll burn you And youve only just come back to life Stay alive a little longer, my friend
davos	You call me friend You drank with me on my wedding day
salladhor	And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I dont ask you for favors
davos	I have to stop her Please, do this for me
salladhor	When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck
roose bolton	We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal
robb	There wont be a siege The Mountain cant defend a ruin
roose bolton	I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend
robb	The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross Id love a fight The men would love a fight I dont think were going to get one
rickard kar	200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep
roose bolton	The debt will be repaid, my friend For them and for your sons
rickard kar	Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free
roose bolton	ingslayer wont remain free for long My best hunters are after him
robb	A Mallister?
catelyn	Ser Jeremy My fathers bannerman
robb	Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell
talisa	Shes your mother
robb	She freed Jaime Lannister The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice
qyburn	Water Water
talisa	This needs to be cleaned and closed
robb	Whats your name, friend?
qyburn	Qyburn
talisa	Youre lucky to be alive
qyburn	Lucky?
tyrion	The badge looks good on you Almost as good as it looked on me Are you enjoying your new position?
tywin	Am I enjoying it?
tyrion	I was very happy as Hand of the King
tywin	Yes I heard how happy you were You brought a whore into my bed
tyrion	It wasnt your bed at the time
tywin	I sent you here to advise the king I gave you real power and authority You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves
tyrion	Occasionally I drank with the harlots
tywin	What do you want, Tyrion?
tyrion	Why does everyone assume I want something? Cant I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield
tywin	Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal
tyrion	I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls I bled in the mud for our family And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start
tywin	Jugglers and singers require applause You are a Lannister Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion So tell me what you want
tyrion	I want what is mine by right Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock I am your son and lawful heir
tywin	You want Casterly Rock?
tyrion	It is mine by right
tywin	Well find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock
tyrion	Why?
tywin	Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning Mens laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my fathers sigil and his fathers before him But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse Go, now Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock Go
tywin	Oh, one more thing The next whore I catch in your bed Ill hang
sansa	Dorne Its going to Dorne
shae	Why Dorne?
sansa	Its carrying silk and its supposed to bring back wine in exchange But its not coming back The captains tired of risking his life so Kings Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve Hes going to stay in Dorne Wait out the winter where its beautiful and warm
shae	I met some people in Dorne who werent so beautiful and warm
sansa	Dont ruin the game
shae	I told you, I dont want to play
sansa	What about that one there?
shae	That one? Its going to Volantis
sansa	Why?
shae	Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one
sansa	Thats not how the game works Youre not supposed to just blurt out the right answer Youve got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why
shae	Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
sansa	Because the truth is always either terrible or boring
littlefinger	Lovely day for it Watching the ships
sansa	Lord Baelish
littlefinger	Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
littlefinger	I saw your mother not long ago Shes very eager to see you And your sister
sansa	Aryas alive? You said youd take me home
littlefinger	You said Kings Landing was your home You are the property of the crown Stealing you would be treason If you were to tell just one person .
sansa	I wont tell anyone
littlefinger	How do I know?
sansa	Because Im a terrible liar You said so yourself Please, Lord Baelish Tell me what to do Tell me when
littlefinger	Im waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me But youll need to be ready to leave on a moments notice
ros	Youre her handmaiden?
shae	Yes And youre his ?
ros	I help manage his affairs
shae	Hes an important person
ros	So is she I grew up in the shadow of her fathers castle The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset Weve both done rather well, you and I
shae	Yes
ros	Given where we started
shae	And where is that?
ros	Its not easy for girls like us to dig our way out Watch out for her
shae	I always do
ros	Watch out for her with him
jorah	Theyre growing fast
daenerys	Not fast enough I cant wait that long I need an army
jorah	Well be in Astapor by nightfall Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world
daenerys	The greatest slave-soldiers in the world The distinction means a good deal to some people
jorah	Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
daenerys	Its too beautiful a day to argue
jorah	Youre right Another lovely day on the high seas
daenerys	Dont mock them Theyre the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship They followed me across the poison water If theyll do it, others will And with a true khalasar .
jorah	The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi Youll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong And not before
davos	Your Grace
stannis	I heard you were dead
davos	Not yet
stannis	I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace
stannis	We are alone
davos	Your Grace, you are the rightful king Not only by blood Youre an honorable man, a just man And there is still a war to fight
stannis	I am fighting
davos	By burning prisoners alive?
melisandre	How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?
davos	I do not judge people for the gods they worship If I did, Id have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone
melisandre	Im not your enemy
davos	You are my enemy
melisandre	Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasnt there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands I could have saved those men You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him But I wasnt there because you convinced your king to leave me behind Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them
melisandre	Dont despair, Ser Davos What I told your son is true
melisandre	Death by fire is the purest death
davos	This woman is evil! Shes the mother of demons
stannis	Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell
davos	Your Grace
guard	Come on
melisandre	Youve chosen the darkness, Ser Davos
davos	She will destroy us all
melisandre	I will pray for you
davos	Your Grace
guard	Halt Down
guard	Halt Down
joffrey	Why have we stopped?
guard	Its Lady Margaery, Your Grace
joffrey	What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
maid	My lady We should have guards, my lady
margaery	Why?
margaery	Pardon me
maid	Stop, my lady Youll ruin your dress
margaery	I have others
guard	Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?
joffrey	No
child	He was a soldier He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay He never came back
margaery	And your mother?
child	She died when she had me
margaery	Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them
margaery	Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father
child	He wasnt a knight He was just a soldier
margaery	And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good Your father did that Be proud of him
margaery	Was your father a soldier, too?
margaery	You should be proud, too Under King Joffreys leadership, your fathers saved the city They saved us all From now on, were going to take care of you All of you
margaery	Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them Directly to me
margaery	Your Grace
loras	Your Grace
joffrey	Please, sit Sit I do apologize, my lady Small council meetings At what point does it become treason to waste the kings time?
joffrey	Thats a lovely gown, my lady
cersei	Yes, it suits you perfectly I imagine you might be rather cold
margaery	The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace
joffrey	Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?
margaery	I am touched by your concern, Your Grace Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm Doesnt it, Loras?
loras	Yes
margaery	Loras, isnt the queens gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork Ive never seen anything like it
cersei	You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen Perhaps before Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning
margaery	Yes I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about
loras	Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden
margaery	The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart
cersei	An open heart is what youll get in Flea Bottom if youre not careful, my dear Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there We had a full complement of guards that didnt stop them The king barely escaped with his life
joffrey	My mothers always had a penchant for drama Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older Our lives were never truly in danger
cersei	Youre right, of course But you are your fathers son We cant all have a kings bravery
margaery	Hunger turns men into beasts Im glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach Wheat, barley, apples Weve had a blessed harvest And, of course, its our duty to assist the capital in time of need
joffrey	Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of charitable work before Im sure she knows what shes doing
cersei	Im sure she does
cut to	The path leading to Astapor KRAZNYS MO
missandei	The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water
missandei	They will stand until they drop
missandei	Such is their obedience
daenerys	They may suit my needs Tell me of their training
missandei	The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down She wished to know how they are trained
kraznys mo nakloz	Tell her what she would know and be quick about it
missandei	They begin their training at five Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training
missandei	Their discipline and loyalty are absolute They fear nothing
jorah	Even the bravest men fear death
missandei	The knight says even brave men fear death
kraznys mo nakloz	Tell the old man he smells of piss
missandei	Truly, master?
kraznys mo nakloz	No, not truly Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?
missandei	My master says the Unsullied are not men Death means nothing to them
kraznys mo nakloz	Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch
missandei	He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace
daenerys	Tell the good master there is no need
kraznys mo nakloz	Shes worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know weve cut off their balls?
missandei	My master points out that men dont need nipples
kraznys mo nakloz	Here, Im done with you
unsullied	This one is pleased to have served you
missandei	To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mothers eyes This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them
daenerys	You take a babe from its mothers arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?
missandei	She is offended She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby
kraznys mo nakloz	What a soft mewling fool this one is
missandei	My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the babys owner, not the mother
daenerys	How many do you have to sell?
missandei	8000 KRAZNYS MO
nakloz	Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow
missandei	Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry Many other buyers are interested
daenerys	8,000 dead babies
jorah	The Unsullied are a means to an end
daenerys	Once I own them, these men .
jorah	Theyre not men Not anymore
daenerys	Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?
jorah	Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
jorah	Youll be fair to them You wont mutilate them to make a point
jorah	You wont order them to murder babies Youll see theyre properly fed and sheltered A great injustice has been done to them Closing your eyes will not undo it
daenerys	The warlocks
daenerys	I owe you my life, ser
barristan selmy	The honor is mine, my queen
daenerys	You know this man?
jorah	I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheons Kingsguard
jon	Dont think too much, Bran
jon	Relax your bow arm
ned	And which one of you was a marksman at 10?
bran	Father?
jojen	You cant kill it, you know
bran	Why not?
jojen	Because the raven is you
hodor	Hodor
bran	Its all right, Hodor
hodor	Hodor
osha	Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?
bran	No, it was the three-eyed raven
osha	Hes back
bran	I tried to kill it, but I couldnt There was a boy
osha	I dont want to hear about it
bran	But you asked
osha	Weve got plenty of worries We dont need to pour black magic on top of them
bran	I didnt ask for black magic dreams
osha	I know you didnt, little lord
osha	We need to move
bran	We dont know who might be after us No one even knows were alive
osha	And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?
bran	No
osha	Some good he is, then
osha	I dont know what other people know and what they dont I only know the Wall is a long way off
talisa	My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds
robb	Did you ever think youd marry one?
talisa	I never thought Id marry anyone at all
robb	Never?
talisa	Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians
roose bolton	Pardon me, Your Grace My queen
talisa	Lord Bolton
robb	Let me guess which one is the good news
roose bolton	Word from Riverrun and Winterfell
catelyn	I hadnt seen him in years I dont even know how many
robb	Well travel to the funeral together Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return
catelyn	Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
catelyn	Something else?
robb	By the time Boltons bastard-RAMSAY got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch And BRAN and RICKON have not been found They may have escaped Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages
catelyn	Have you received any demands?
robb	No
catelyn	Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
theon	Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
torturer	I want to do this
jaime	Do you know how long its going to take us to get to Kings Landing walking through fields and forests?
brienne	Yes
jaime	So how shall we pass the time?
brienne	By putting one foot in front of the other
jaime	Its going to be a very dull walk
brienne	Im here to take you to Kings Landing and bring back Lady Starks daughters in exchange Dull is fine
jaime	You know, it doesnt matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute Trust me on this People have been serving me since I was born You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A weeks journey with you and shell order you to fall on your sword
brienne	If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, Im sure shell let me know Shes an honest woman
jaime	All the good its done her
jaime	How did you come into Lady Starks service? Theres something we can talk about
brienne	Not your concern, Kingslayer
jaime	It had to be recently You werent with her at Winterfell
brienne	How would you know?
jaime	Because I visited Winterfell I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways
brienne	Move
jaime	Were you pledged to Stannis?
brienne	Gods, no
jaime	Ah, Renly Really? He wasnt fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal
brienne	Shut your mouth
jaime	Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, dont forget Could hardly escape the little tulip Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks I knew him far better than you
brienne	I knew him as well as anyone As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything He would have been a wonderful king
jaime	Sounds like you quite fancied him
brienne	I did not fancy him
jaime	Oh, gods, you did
jaime	Did you ever tell him? No, of course not You werent Renlys type, Im afraid
jaime	He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell Youre far too much man for him
brienne	Im not interested in foul rumors
jaime	Unless theyre about me Its all true about Renly His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court Its a shame the throne isnt made out of cocks Theyd have never got him off it
brienne	Shut your mouth
jaime	I dont blame him And I dont blame you, either We dont get to choose who we love
man	Where are you headed, then?
brienne	South You?
man	Riverrun Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go You cant win
jaime	No, you really cant
man	Looks like youre safe enough, though Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldnt tangle with you Seven blessings to you
brienne	And you
jaime	He knows who I am
brienne	He doesnt
jaime	Maybe youre right But what if youre not? What if he tells someone?
brienne	Were not doing it Hes an innocent man
jaime	More innocent than Lady Starks daughters?
joffrey	Make it tighter here
cersei	Thats better It makes you look very strong
joffrey	No flowers I said no flowers All these are wrong Bring others
tailor	Yes, Your Grace
joffrey	Bloody flowers On the king
cersei	Looks like a Tyrell rose Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown Should be more than enough fabric
cersei	Tell me what you think of her
joffrey	Who?
cersei	Margaery
joffrey	Shes an ideal match With the Tyrells beside us, well crush the Northerners Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century
cersei	It is a good match, but what do you think of her? Shes beautiful and intelligent
joffrey	Yes, she is
cersei	Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting
joffrey	Not to me
cersei	I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself
joffrey	This is becoming one of the most boring conversations Ive ever had
cersei	Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason She dresses like a harlot for a reason She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason
joffrey	She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to Thats what intelligent women do-what theyre told
cersei	You need to ask yourself
joffrey	I dont need to do anything
joffrey	Better Much better
shae	I still dont believe it
sansa	He didnt He didnt want anything He just takes an interest because he loved my mother
shae	Men only want one thing from a pretty girl
sansa	Littlefingers not in love with me
shae	Love is not the thing he wants
sansa	Hes too old
shae	They never see it that way He didnt ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or?
sansa	No
shae	If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me
sansa	Why? What will you do? I will make him stop
guard	Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady
sansa	Send him in
loras	Lady Sansa
sansa	Ser Loras
loras	My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens May I escort you to them?
loras	I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa
sansa	You are too kind, Ser Loras You probably dont remember the first time we met At the Hands tourney, you gave me your favor A rose, a red rose
loras	Of course I did
margaery	Its more your color You take it
maid	Thank you
margaery	Youre such a dear
loras	Ill take my leave Lady Sansa
sansa	Thank you, Ser Loras
margaery	Come Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell
olenna	Kiss me, child
olenna	Its so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens Were very sorry for your losses
sansa	And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renlys death, Lady Margaery He was very gallant
olenna	Gallant, yes And charming and very clean He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king
margaery	Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother Father liked him and so did Loras
olenna	Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick That does not make him wise As to your fathead father
margaery	Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
olenna	She might think we have some wits about us One of us, at any rate It was treason I warned them Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me But once the cows been milked, theres no squirting the cream back up her udders So here we are to see things through What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?
sansa	Lemon cakes my favorite
olenna	So weve been told Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me Im much less boring than these others
olenna	Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
sansa	I havent had the pleasure
olenna	No great pleasure, believe me A ponderous oaf His father was an oaf as well My husband, the late Lord Luthor He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him And now my son is doing the same, only this time hes riding a lion instead of a horse Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey
sansa	I , I-
olenna	You, you Who else would know better? Weve heard some troubling tales Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?
olenna	Has he ripped out your tongue?
sansa	Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion
olenna	Yes, all Lannisters are lions And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?
margaery	Im to be his wife I only want to know what that means
olenna	Bring me some cheese
servant	The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady
olenna	The cheese will be served when I want it served And I want it served now
olenna	Are you frightened, child? No need for that Were only women here Tell us the truth No harm will come to you
sansa	My father always told the truth
olenna	Yes, he had that reputation And they named him traitor and took his head
sansa	Joffrey Joffrey did that He promised he would be merciful and he cut my fathers head off And he said that was mercy Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it
olenna	Go on
sansa	I-I cant I never meant-my father was a traitor My brother as well I have traitors blood Please dont make me say anymore
margaery	Shes terrified, Grandmother Just look at her
olenna	Speak freely, child We would never betray your confidence, I swear it
sansa	Hes a monster
olenna	Ah Thats a pity
sansa	Please, dont stop the wedding
olenna	Have no fear The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen Even so, we thank you for the truth Ah, here comes my cheese
rickard kar	Were at war This march is a distraction
robb	My grandfathers funeral is not a distraction
rickard kar	Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
robb	No
rickard kar	Then its a distraction
robb	My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there We need his men
rickard kar	Unless hes been breeding them, he dont have enough to make a difference
robb	Have you lost faith in our cause?
rickard kar	If its revenge, I still got faith in it
robb	If you no longer believe
rickard kar	I can believe till it snows in Dorne Dont change the fact that weve got half the men
robb	You dont think we can win?
rickard kar	May I speak my mind, Your Grace?
robb	Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?
rickard kar	I think you lost this war the day you married her
talisa	Whoa, whoa
man	Your Grace
catelyn	Youre afraid of her And she knows it
talisa	Im not afraid of her May I help you, Lady Stark?
catelyn	No
talisa	Im sorry, I shouldnt have
catelyn	You cant help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them Only a mother can make them
talisa	Youve made them before?
catelyn	Twice
talisa	Did they work?
catelyn	After a fashion I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall
catelyn	Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, hed live But it would be a very long night So I sat with him all through the darkness Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering
talisa	Which boy?
catelyn	Jon Snow When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldnt bear to look at him I didnt want to see those brown strangers eyes staring up at me So I prayed to the gods, take him away Make him die He got the pox And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived A murderer Id condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother A woman he didnt even know So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live Let him live and Ill love him Ill be a mother to him Ill beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us
talisa	And he lived
catelyn	And he lived And I couldnt keep my promise And everything thats happened since then all this horror thats come to my family its all because I couldnt love a motherless child
mance	Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
jon	Yes
mance	You liked him? I like you, but if youre playing us false, it wont be hard for me to kill you Ive got wildling blood in my veins These are my people
jon	I understand
mance	Well, how could you understand?
jon	You want to protect your people
mance	Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army The Thenns hate the Hornfoots The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans Everyone hates the cave people So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?
jon	No
mance	I told them we were all going to die if we dont get south Because thats the truth
tormund	Shouldnt be long now

rast	Looks like that piggy is done for
grenn	Help us get him up
rast	Hes slowing us down
grenn	Just get him up
rast	Why? So the rest of us can die? Well move faster without him
jeor	What is this? Get up, Tarly Is he all right?
grenn	Aye, I think so
rast	If he cant, we may as well just go without him
jeor	Thats enough Tarly, I forbid you to die Do you hear me?
rast	Why should the rest of us
jeor	Rast youre responsible for him
rast	What am I supposed to do?
jeor	Make sure he gets back alive If he doesnt, you dont Move on

arya	Im not listening
gendry	But just explain it to me He offered to kill any three people you wanted Dead All you had to do was give him the names Anyone You could have picked King Joffrey
arya	Shut up
gendry	You could have picked Tywin Lannister
arya	Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?
gendry	But you could have ended the war
arya	Where are we going?
gendry	North
arya	If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now
gendry	Maybe we already passed it
arya	Its 100 feet wide How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun My mother grew up there My grandfather hes a lord Hell protect us
gendry	Could be a minstrel
arya	Shut up
thoros	A lion still has claws HOT
pie	A minstrels got gold sometimes We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food
arya	Shh
thoros	And so he spoke, and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains Weep oer his hall With no one there to hear
thoros	Whats lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
anguy	Just a dirty little cub, I think
thoros	Loose a few more shafts

arya	You go on down the road Just keep on singing so we know where you are Leave us be and I wont kill you
anguy	Generous
thoros	Youre a dangerous person I like dangerous people Why are your friends so shy?

anguy	The fat to your left and the lad beside him
thoros	Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords You escape from Harrenhal?
arya	Who are you?
thoros	Thoros of Myr And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy
arya	No, who do you fight for?
thoros	The Brotherhood without Banners Now come along I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal
hot pie	Im not going with them The Brotherhood? Thats who the Mountain and them lot were looking for Theyll bring us back and put rats in us
thoros	Youve got nothing to fear from us, son The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside Were trying to save it Now come on Well talk some more over brown bread and stew And then you can go on your way
anguy	Heres the thing
fat anguy	When Im done talking, that arrows falling down on your fat head So I advise you move, because Im done talking
anguy	Half the countrys starving and look at this one
thoros	Maybe hes the reason half the countrys starving
shae	My lion
tyrion	Weve spoken of this You cannot come here
shae	But you said I should come to you with any problems
tyrion	Did anyone see you? No
shae	No
tyrion	You sure? My father does not make idle threats Having you killed would be the high point of his week You have to be absolutely certain
tyrion	All right What is this problem?
shae	Im worried about Sansa When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him
tyrion	Baelish doesnt have friends
shae	I dont know her name
tyrion	Oh, Ros? The redhead?
shae	How do you know her?
tyrion	I try to know as many people as I can You never know which one youll need
shae	Shes a whore
tyrion	Yes, well, we shouldnt be judgmental about these things
shae	You fucked her
tyrion	Oh, please All right, yes, I fucked her once Twice
tyrion	But since I met you, my lady, Ive been with no one else
shae	And was she good? Did you like her?
tyrion	Not as much as I like you, obviously, or shed be the one torturing me right now What did she say about Littlefinger?
shae	That Sansa shouldnt trust him
tyrion	Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
shae	We have to protect her
tyrion	We cant Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors A great beauty with a very old name
shae	A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?
tyrion	Yes, she is, objectively, very Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general But not to me, of course I only have eyes for you
shae	You pervert You want her? This child?
tyrion	I dont even want to talk about her
shae	But you are
tyrion	Only because youre making me
shae	I didnt force you to open your mouth and make words come out
tyrion	This is cruel and unfair Cruelly unfair
shae	Oh, the cruelty Shae is so cruel to me
tyrion	Hmm, yes
shae	Now do you think Im cruel?
tyrion	Only if you stop But you mustnt come here again
tyrion	Do you hear me? Youve come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people Dangerous people
guard	Lady Tyrell, my king
joffrey	Send her in
margaery	You wanted to see me, Your Grace?
joffrey	Im leaving on a hunting trip I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left
margaery	Thats very thoughtful, Your Grace I have everything I could want
joffrey	Good Good How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renlys camp
margaery	A welcome one A military encampment is no place for a lady
joffrey	And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
margaery	Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all
joffrey	What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
margaery	The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children
joffrey	You failed to do this
margaery	Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace
joffrey	You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because hes had a sword put through his heart?
margaery	No I do beg your pardon The subtleties of politics are often lost on me Renly I dont believe he was interested in the company of women
joffrey	What makes you say this?
margaery	Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils He never wanted to try Except one evening, after hed had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldnt possibly result in children Maybe the fault was with me
joffrey	No, he was a known degenerate
margaery	Its such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace
joffrey	Mmm Ive considered making his perversion punishable by death
margaery	As is your right You must do whatever you need to do
margaery	You are the king
joffrey	Yes I am
joffrey	Do you like it? I just had it made Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms
margaery	Its beautiful Will you show me how it works?
joffrey	Its a new design Much easier to load Theres no crank You use this lever to draw the string
joffrey	The bolt goes here
joffrey	And then you just aim and
margaery	Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace I know a hunt is no place for a woman
joffrey	Its not unheard of
margaery	My father would never let me before
joffrey	You no longer belong to him Do you want to hold it?
margaery	May I? Please
margaery	I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there
joffrey	Could you do it? Could you kill something?
margaery	I dont know, Your Grace Do you think I could?
joffrey	Yes
margaery	Would you like to watch me?
joffrey	Yes
theon	Stop! Stop
torturer	Tell us the truth
theon	About what?
theon	I dont know what you want
torturer	I want the truth
theon	What truth?
torturer	Whyd you take Winterfell?
theon	I took it to-I took it
torturer	Who gave the orders?
theon	No one I took it on my own
torturer	Why?
theon	To take the North while it was vulnerable
torturer	What were you going to do once you took it?
theon	Hold it Rule it
torturer	Good Thats very good
theon	Why did you do that?
torturer	I told you Why did you take Winterfell?
theon	I took it to bring glory to my house and my father
theon	Wait Wait, wait, wait I took it because I hated the Starks I hated them for holding me prisoner I wanted to hurt them
theon	What are you doing?
theon	Please
theon	Ill tell you anything Just take it off Please Please, just take it off
ramsay	Your sister sent me
theon	Yara?
ramsay	Ill come for you tonight when the castle sleeps
theon	No, dont go Please, please No, please dont leave me Please, please Please, please dont go! Please Please Dont leave me Please dont go
osha	Rickon, stay with us
bran	Its all right The wolves will protect him
jojen	You can get inside his head, see through his eyes
bran	Only when Im asleep
jojen	Thats how it begins until you learn to control it Youre a warg
bran	Its not just wolves Sometimes in my dreams theres a
jojen	A three-eyed raven?
bran	Youve seen it?
jojen	We saw him together You havent forgotten?
bran	Does it have anything to do with warging?
jojen	No, the raven is something different, something deeper The raven brings the sight
bran	Seeing things that havent happened yet?
jojen	Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away
osha	Whats he telling him?
meera	Why dont you ask?
osha	Isnt he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?
meera	Wheres the shame in that?
osha	Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting
meera	Some people will always need help That doesnt mean theyre not worth helping
bran	When my father died, I dreamt it
jojen	You didnt dream it You saw it So did I
bran	You have the sight, too?
jojen	When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry
bran	Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah
jojen	Yeah
bran	He saved my fathers life during the rebellion
jojen	Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did But I saw that, too
bran	What else have you seen?
jojen	Only one thing that matters-you
man	I never liked the skinny ones Like drinking from a puddle Not that Im averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand
arya	I dont drink ale
thoros	Theres no story so good a drink wont make it better
man	Yeah
thoros	You see? Theyve all suffered through my bouts of sobriety Its very tedious for all concerned Now, how did three children
arya	Were not children
thoros	How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?
arya	Gendrys a smith He was apprenticed in the armory
thoros	A smith, eh? Whered you train?
gendry	Kings Landing Tobho Motts shop
thoros	That criminal He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city
gendry	Thats because hes twice as good
thoros	Aha! A smith and a salesman
arya	Gendry stole us weapons
thoros	Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see
arya	He knows how to use a sword and so do I
arya	My brothers taught me
men	Ooh
thoros	To your brothers
thoros	You can finish your meals before you go It may be awhile before you see another
arya	Youll free us?
thoros	I gave you my word But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your
anguy	Hey, hey
thoros	Now that is an uncommonly large person How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
anguy	One waits for him to drink until he passes out
thoros	Poor man You have my sympathy
thoros	Aha, not a man at all A Hound
thoros	So good to see you again, Clegane
sandor	Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
thoros	Drinking and talking too much Same as ever
thoros	A pretty prize, lads
men	Yeah
sandor	Girl
sandor	What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
jaime	Its a tough decision-take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water
brienne	Silence, Kingslayer
jaime	Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river
brienne	Good luck
jaime	Its wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas Which will she choose?
jaime	Gambler at heart Wouldnt have guessed
brienne	Be quick about it
jaime	I need to rest
brienne	Get up
jaime	I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far What do you call them?
brienne	Get up now
jaime	Corns I never used to get corns Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year
jaime	This heel is ruined Theres no way
jaime	I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords
jaime	Ooh You move well for a great beast of a woman
jaime	You shouldnt grimace before you lunge It gives away the game
jaime	Bit of a quandary for you If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark But if you dont kill me, Im going to kill you
jaime	Youre good Graceless, but good
jaime	See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there
locke	Looks like your womans getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman
jaime	We enjoy a good fight Gets our juices flowing The Flayed Man of House Bolton A bit gruesome for my taste
locke	You sure hes the one?
man	Thats him, all right I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Freys wedding
locke	Give the man his silver
jaime	Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want
edmure	If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-
brynden	Why dont you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And dont call him nephew He is your king
edmure	Robb knows I meant him no disr-
brynden	Youre lucky Im not your king I wouldnt let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag
edmure	My blunder sent Tywins mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs I think King Robb understands were not gonna win this war if hes the only one winning any battles No, theres glory enough to go around
robb	Its not about glory Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you
edmure	I seized an opportunity
robb	What value was the mill?
edmure	The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it
robb	Is he there now? Of course not
edmure	We took the fight to him He could not withstand us
robb	I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head I could have that head on a spike by now Instead, I have a mill
edmure	We took hostages Willem Lannister Martyn Lannister
robb	Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old
brynden	Martyn is 15, I believe
robb	Tywin Lannister has my sisters Have I sued for peace?
edmure	No
robb	Do you think hell sue for peace because we have his fathers brothers great-grandsons?
edmure	No
robb	How many men did you lose?
edmure	But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-
robb	We need our men more than Tywin needs his
edmure	Im sorry I didnt know
robb	You would have Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient
brynden	We seem to be running short of patience here
robb	You know who isnt? Tywin Lannister TYWIN stands by the head of the table PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER enter silently enters next TYWIN sits, then PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER join him remains still, while CERSEI enters and surveys the room She pauses, then walks to the table She picks up one of the two remaining empty chairs and places it directly next to TYWIN, then sits while the others smirk comes forward, and drags the final chair noisily to the opposite head of the table
tyrion	Intimate Lovely table Better chairs than the old small council chamber Conveniently close to your own quarters I like it
tywin	What news of Jaime?
tywin	20,000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?
varys	We are trying, my lord
tywin	Try harder What do we have, then?
varys	Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully In Starks absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name
tywin	Well, let him have it The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn
littlefinger	For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children She has always been positively predisposed toward me
pycelle	A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale
littlefinger	Titles do seem to breed titles
tywin	Youll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him
tyrion	Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelishs absence would present certain problems The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead Not a good time to leave the crowns finances unattended
tywin	Fully agreed Which is why Im naming you new Master of Coin
tyrion	Master of Coin?
tywin	It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents
tyrion	Im quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasnt taught me much about managing it
cersei	I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge
pycelle	Hear, hear
men	He lifted her high in the air He sniffed and roared and smelled her there She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair But he licked the honey from her hair From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered with hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear and the maiden fair
jaime	I hope youre pleased If you had armed me, they never would have taken us
brienne	You were armed when we were taken
jaime	I was in chains if you recall Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands werent bound
brienne	All my life Ive been hearing, Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman You were slower than I expected And more predictable
jaime	Ive been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year
brienne	And Im a woman I was still beating you
jaime	You were not beating me
brienne	Maybe you were as good as people said once Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name
jaime	When we make camp tonight, youll be raped More than once None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman Youd be wise not to resist
brienne	Would I?
jaime	Theyll knock your teeth out
brienne	You think I care about my teeth?
jaime	No, I dont think you care about your teeth If you fight them, they will kill you Do you understand? Im the prisoner of value, not you Let them have what they want What does it matter?
brienne	What does it matter?
jaime	Close your eyes Pretend theyre Renly
brienne	If you were a woman, you wouldnt resist? Youd let them do what they wanted?
jaime	If I was a woman, Id make them kill me But Im not, thank the gods
gendry	If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new
thoros	Doesnt have to look pretty It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart
arya	Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now hes our friend?
thoros	Youre not our prisoner, little lady
arya	What am I?

catelyn	A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting were at war
brynden	It often comforts me to think that even in wars darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening
catelyn	Ive missed you, Uncle Father missed you, too, from the day you left Maybe he never said it in so many words-
brynden	Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox I was surprised when he died Didnt think death had the patience
catelyn	Im glad you were with him I wish to the gods I had been Did you make peace in the end?
brynden	After 30 years of fighting, I dont think he remembered what started it He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they dont remember my real name
catelyn	Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, Id see him off Wait for me, little Cat, hed say Wait for me and Ill come back to you And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return I will never see them again
brynden	You mustnt think it We dont know the truth They could be in hiding Robb believes theyre alive And he must go on believing Hes got to remain strong if hes to prevail And you must remain strong for him
martyn	Youre Robb Starks wife
talisa	Hold still
martyn	Is it true what they say about him?
talisa	I dont know What do they say about him?
martyn	That he can turn into a wolf at night
talisa	True
martyn	And he eats the flesh of his enemies
talisa	True Youre a Lannister, arent you?
martyn	Martyn Lannister
talisa	Martyn Lannister Youve nothing to fear My husband doesnt eat children Unless its a full moon Its not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear

mance	And you know what those men are now?
mance	Were all the same to them meat for their army
jon	Do you think anyone got away?
mance	Its not impossible You dont go far betting against Mormont But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north And he lost His best fighting men are dead And whether hes Lord Commander of the Nights Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, hes a long way from home Tormund Climb the Wall Take Orell and 20 good men And take this one He knows Castle Blacks defenses better than any of us And if hes useful, good If not throw him off the Wall See if crows can fly
tormund	Were finally going to war, old friend?
mance	Hide near Castle Black When I give the signal, hit them in the night Theyve got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side
tormund	Well meet again
mance	Aye If you do your job Ah
orell	How will we see your signal?
mance	Send your eagle above the Wall every night When its time, Im going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen

jeor	You are a godly man?
craster	I am I got no fear of whats out there When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires wont help you The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods The real gods
craster	Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist Women That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight Barely a grunt And shes almost as fat as this one here Now why dont you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go Well, look at him Hes a walking feast

stannis	You refuse to tell me where youre going?
melisandre	I dont know yet The fires will show me
stannis	How long will you be gone?
melisandre	I dont know
stannis	Youre abandoning me
melisandre	I will never abandon you You are the Son of Fire I am sworn to serve you
stannis	Then serve me
melisandre	When I return, you will understand
stannis	My enemies think theyve destroyed me Theyre laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me I want Joffrey dead I want Robb Stark dead Make me another son
melisandre	I cannot
stannis	Why?
melisandre	You dont have the strength It would kill you
stannis	Im not so easily killed Men have been trying for years
stannis	I want you
melisandre	Your fires burn low, my king
melisandre	There is another way A better way
stannis	You told me your magic requires a kings blood
melisandre	Yes
stannis	Im the one true king
melisandre	You are But there are others with your blood in their veins You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices The Lord of Light demands it
barristan	The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace
daenerys	To whom?
barristan	To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did
daenerys	Give me your water
jorah	Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death
daenerys	Here, drink
barristan	Leave this place, Your Grace Leave tonight, I beg you
jorah	And what is she to do for soldiers?
barristan	We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr
jorah	Is it we already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done
daenerys	The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents
jorah	How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?
barristan	Three
jorah	Have you ever seen a war where innocents didnt die by the thousands?
jorah	I was in Kings Landing after the sack, khaleesi You know what I saw? Butchery Babies, children, old men More women raped than you can count Theres a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand But the Unsullied are not men They do not rape They do not put cities to the sword unless theyre ordered to do so If you buy them, the only men theyll kill are those you want dead
daenerys	Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?
barristan	When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because theyd been bought at a slavers auction I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace I bled beside him
jorah	Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died
daenerys	Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?
barristan	I did, Your Grace Finest man I ever met
daenerys	I wish I had known him But he was not the last dragon
missandei	All? Did this ones ears mishear, Your Grace?
daenerys	They did not I want to buy them all
missandei	She wants to buy them all
kraznys	She cant afford them The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants
missandei	There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor Is this what you mean by all?
daenerys	Yes 8,000 And the ones still in training as well
greizhen	If they fail on the battlefield, they will shape Astapor
missandei	Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor
daenerys	I will have them all or take none Many will fall in battle Ill need the boys to pick up the swords they drop
kraznys	The slut cannot pay for all of this
missandei	Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this
kraznys	Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied, no more
missandei	Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous
kraznys	And this is because I like the curve of her ass
missandei	The gold you have left is worth 10
kraznys	What is left will buy her 10 I will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering
missandei	But good Master Kraznys will give you 20
kraznys	Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed
missandei	The Dothraki you have with you-
kraznys	I will give her 3 for those
missandei	The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them
kraznys	So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?
missandei	Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied
daenerys	I have dragons Ill give you one
barristan	You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace
jorah	Khaleesi, please
kraznys	Three dragons
daenerys	One
kraznys	Two
daenerys	One
missandei	They want the biggest one
daenerys	Done
kraznys	Done
daenerys	Ill take you as well, now Youll be Master Kraznys gift to me A token of a bargain well struck
missandei	She asks that you give me to her, as a present She asks that you do this now
jorah	Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army
barristan	Aegon Targaryen proved that
daenerys	Youre both here to advise me I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, youll be advising someone else Is that understood?
daenerys	Do you have a name?
missandei	This ones name is Missandei, Your Grace
daenerys	Do you have a family? A mother and a father youd return to if you had the choice?
missandei	No, Your Grace No family living
daenerys	You belong to me now It is your duty to tell me the truth
missandei	Yes, Your Grace Lying is a great offense Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less
daenerys	I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment Do you know what he said to me? Let me die
missandei	There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace
daenerys	Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
missandei	All questions have been taken from them They obey, that is all Once they are yours, they are yours They will fall on their swords if you command it
daenerys	And what about you? You know that Im taking you to war You may go hungry You may fall sick You may be killed
missandei	Valar morghulis
daenerys	Yes, all men must die But we are not men
tyrion	A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers
littlefinger	Im surprised youre surprised This is the safest place in the city
tyrion	Not for bastards
ros	Thats all of them, my lord
littlefinger	Thank you, my dear
tyrion	Pod Pod Take them outside Ill be there in a moment
podrick	Yes, my lord
littlefinger	I hear you owe that boy a significant debt
tyrion	Only my life Not all that significant, Im afraid
littlefinger	You should have him knighted
tyrion	If only the Master of Coin had such power
littlefinger	If only I owe you a significant debt Our redheaded friend You secured her release when the queen detained her
tyrion	Oh, that Of course A simple misunderstanding
littlefinger	Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship
tyrion	We dont I did fuck her once
littlefinger	I know
tyrion	But we dont
littlefinger	I know But how would the queen get that idea?
tyrion	Why dont you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
littlefinger	Keep a low profile
tyrion	If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, Id be richer than you are
littlefinger	Well, you are richer than I am
tyrion	Good point
littlefinger	Theyre only numbers Numbers on paper Once you understand that, its easy to make them behave Trivial even You want a real challenge? Try whores
tyrion	Ive tried quite a few Well, lots of work to do Enjoy the Eyrie
bronn	Come on, Im here later Come on
bronn	Tonight, then Looks like dull reading
tyrion	You think all reading is dull reading
bronn	Its an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know
tyrion	The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages
bronn	Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what hes really up to
tyrion	Unless he made it all up, yes Podrick, do keep up
podrick	Yes, my lord
tyrion	Podrick
podrick	Yes, my lord?
tyrion	After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services youve provided over and above what might be considered reasonable Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?
podrick	No, my lord
tyrion	Wonderful Genna specializes in first-timers
bronn	Shes not bad with second-timers, either
podrick	Uh
tyrion	A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killers face, wouldnt you say?
tyrion	Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself Shes here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me
marei	Hes handsome You didnt tell me he was handsome
tyrion	Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot
podrick	My lord
tyrion	Shes here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow whos never once failed to address me as my lord
tyrion	Be back in time for my supper
bronn	Pace yourself, lad
tyrion	For years Ive heard that Littlefinger is a magician Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold
bronn	Let me guess Hes not a magician
tyrion	No
bronn	Hes stealing it?
tyrion	Worse, hes borrowing it
bronn	Whats wrong with that?
tyrion	We cant afford to pay it back, thats whats wrong with it The crown owes millions to my father
bronn	Seeing as its his grandsons ass on the throne, I imagine hell forgive that debt
tyrion	Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, youre strangely naive
bronn	Ive never borrowed money before Im not clear on the rules
tyrion	Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest
bronn	And what if I dont?
tyrion	Well, you have to
bronn	But what if I dont?
tyrion	This is why I dont lend you money Anyway, its not my father Im worried about Its the Iron Bank of Braavos We owe them tens of millions If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies One way or another, they always get their gold back
tyrion	Ah, the return of the conquering hero Does he have a little jaunt in his step?
bronn	The lads practically skipping
tyrion	You were gone a long time I trust you got your moneys worth Or should I say my moneys worth?
tyrion	Oh, it was a gift, Podrick This is more than I give you in a year
bronn	Hes a squire You dont pay him
tyrion	Oh, then its much more than I give you in a year
podrick	They wouldnt take it, my lord
bronn	Maybe theyre trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin
tyrion	Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them
bronn	What did you tell them?
podrick	I didnt tell them anything
tyrion	What did you do to them?
podrick	Lots of things
tyrion	And they seemed to like these things?
podrick	Yes, my lord
bronn	Of course they seemed to like it Theyre paid to seem to like it
tyrion	Only they werent paid
bronn	What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?
tyrion	Is that what youre telling us? {PODRICK doesnt deny it
tyrion	Sit down, Podrick
tyrion	Were going to need details Copious details
theon	Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on
soldier	Ha! Ha
soldier	You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?

locke	Hard to argue with that
jaime	Now that were speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree Im not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it Im not as young and resilient as I was once

varys	Oh, Lord Tyrion Come in, come in
tyrion	I hope we might speak In confidence
varys	Oh, always in confidence
tyrion	About the events of the Blackwater Perhaps this is the wrong time?
varys	Oh, no Its a wonderful time
tyrion	I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sisters intentions to-
varys	End your life?
tyrion	I didnt inherit Littlefingers spies along with his position, Im afraid Which is why Im coming to you I need proof
varys	Proof? Will there be a trial?
tyrion	I need to know
varys	I have no proof, only whispers Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut Do you want to hear it still?
tyrion	I dont know Do I?
varys	As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse I feared the man meant to use me as Id heard some men used small boys But what he wanted was far worse He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while He burned my parts in a brazier The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call I still dream of that night Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade I dream of the voice from the flames Was it a god? A demon? A conjurors trick? I dont know But the sorcerer called and a voice answered And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess A symbolic revenge of sorts
tyrion	Yes, ahem I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed Which will require a degree of influence, which-
varys	You do not possess at the moment
varys	But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found Once I had served the sorcerers purpose, he threw me out of his house to die I resolved to live to spite him I begged I sold what parts of my body remained to me I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a mans letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber Influence grows like a weed I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special
tyrion	The sorcerer
varys	Hello, my old friend Its been a long time I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it
grenn	When people talk about the Nights Watch, they never mention the shoveling
eddison	Or the shit
grenn	They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it
eddison	And getting attacked or killed or worse And that
grenn	But when youre not getting attacked or killed, usually youre shoveling
eddison	Oh, look More shit I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day
rast	We need to get out of here
grenn	When the Lord Commander says we go, we go
rast	The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men Howd that turn out for us?
eddison	He had no way of knowing
rast	We do now We know whats out there
grenn	Crasters been out here surviving
rast	So hes your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
eddison	Were like the sons he never had
rast	Mormont isnt gonna save you This lummox here isnt gonna save you When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs If we want to live well have to look out for ourselves
gilly	Shh, shh, shh
gilly	You woke him
sam	Im sorry Hes beautiful
gilly	Shh
sam	Hes beautiful Does he have a name?
gilly	No
sam	Are you going to give him one?

sam	Gilly
gilly	You said to hold it for you until you came back Youre back
sam	I wanted you to have it
gilly	I dont want your stupid thimble I want to save my babys life Can you do that? Can you?
gilly	I dont have time for you I dont have time for anyone but him because he doesnt have much time
jojen	You have to go after him
bran	How?
jojen	You know how
catelyn	Brandon
bran	Mother
catelyn	How many times have I told you? No climbing
bran	Mother, I need to find it Its here Its calling me
catelyn	I want you to promise me No more climbing
catelyn	Promise me Promise me! Promise me
bran	Mother! Mother
catelyn	Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me
varys	Is he very large?
ros	No larger than usual, apparently And yet they said that he was-
varys	Extraordinary
ros	The most extraordinary man theyve ever had And theyve had a lot of men
varys	Were talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrions service? Seems a bit simple?
varys	What did he do to them?
ros	I dont know, my lord The girls are usually quite descriptive
varys	So what did they say?
ros	They said it was hard to describe
varys	Huh Prodigies appear in the oddest of places And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
ros	He was too preoccupied to notice Hes leaving for the Eyrie soon Im helping him prepare for his journey
varys	Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her Sad, really Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
ros	He hasnt spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know But I dont think hes lost interest
varys	What makes you say so?
ros	His shipboard inventory
varys	Ah You can read Rare for a woman in your profession
ros	Former profession
varys	Of course Im missing something obvious youre about to point out?
ros	Two featherbeds Hes bringing two featherbeds for the cabin
varys	Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
ros	Hes not interested in them, my lord
varys	How do you know?
ros	Because Im one of his girls
varys	Prodigies in odd places indeed
joffrey	Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon It ate her while her son watched Whats left of her is buried in the crypts right down there
cersei	The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably
olenna	There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else
cersei	There arent more than 700 people of any importance
olenna	No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats
joffrey	Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen Aerion Brightflame they called him He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon
joffrey	He was wrong And, of course, theres the Mad King, killed by my uncle Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
cersei	Are you sure Lady Margaery doesnt find all this a bit macabre?
margaery	Oh, no, its quite all right, Your Grace Id love to see their tombs, really Its like taking a walk through history
joffrey	The tombs just up here
margaery	This is so exciting
olenna	You were married here, Your Grace?
cersei	Yes
olenna	Must seem like only yesterday
cersei	Seems like a lifetime ago
olenna	Your husband, was he buried here as well?
cersei	No, he wanted his remains returned to Storms End
olenna	Such a tragedy
cersei	A fairly predictable tragedy Hunting and drinking dont mix
olenna	I should say not My sons a hunter It helps him forget hes never been within a mile of a real battle
cersei	I seem to recall he laid siege to Storms End for the better part of a year
olenna	All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent
olenna	I told him to stay out of Roberts rebellion He had no business fighting an actual warrior We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave But they do seem to yearn for it We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing
cersei	And yet the world belongs to them
olenna	A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind
cersei	The gods have seen fit to make it so
joffrey	My father didnt want them here He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise
margaery	Im glad he did Im sorry, Your Grace I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness
joffrey	I couldnt agree more
margaery	Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold Ive spoken with them I know how they feel about you You led the defense of Kings Landing They adore you
joffrey	Open the doors
cersei	Joffrey Wait
woman	Lady Margaery
woman	Lady Margaery
woman	Bless you, Lady Margaery
woman	Lady Margaery
woman	Lady Margaery
woman	Margaery
woman	Long live Lady Margaery
man	King Joffrey
woman	King Joffrey
woman	King Joffrey
man	King Joffrey
man	Gods bless King Joffrey
theon	How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
ramsay	Not far, my lord Your sister is waiting for you there
theon	She sent you to save me?
ramsay	Yes I served them, the men who were torturing you I did what they told me and waited for the right moment
theon	Why would you risk your life for me?
ramsay	I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord I was only a boy when they took you away My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off I remember the look on my fathers face when he told us, Thats Balon Greyjoys last living son And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you
theon	Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me Did he?
ramsay	I I dont know, my lord They they never told me much
theon	My sisters men are loyal to her We dont need to hide from them
ramsay	Not all those are your sisters men Some of them are loyal to your father
ramsay	What is it?
theon	I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place
ramsay	What did he tell you to do?
theon	Raid fishing villages He didnt trust me Thought I was a Stark Ha I could never be a Stark Robb Stark always reminded me of that
ramsay	He lorded it over you?
theon	Didnt have to All he had to do was be Be who he was born to be His life fit him better than his clothes How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? Hes the King in the North
theon	And me my father gave me a choice and I made it I could never be a Stark But ironborn, thats what I was born to be I paid the iron price for Winterfell I murdered those boys
ramsay	The Stark boys?
theon	Never found them Just some poor orphans living with a farmer I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud
ramsay	Maybe its not too late
theon	It is My real father lost his head at Kings Landing I made a choice and I chose wrong And now Ive burned everything down
ramsay	Not everything, my lord Shes up here
theon	Yara
ramsay	Shh Wait
ramsay	I brought him back He killed the others
theon	What? No, I didnt
theon	You cant! No, please stop! No
ramsay	Put him back where he belongs
brienne	Eat What are you doing?
jaime	Im dying
brienne	You cant die You need to live to take revenge
jaime	I dont care about revenge
brienne	You coward A little misfortune and youre giving up
jaime	Misfor misfortune?
brienne	You lost your hand
jaime	My sword hand I was that hand
brienne	You have a taste one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit You sound like a bloody woman
brienne	I know what you did for me You told them Tarth was full of sapphires Its called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water You knew that Why did you help me?
tywin	You wanted to speak to me?
cersei	Yes, about Jaime
tywin	What about him?
cersei	I wanted to make sure were doing everything we can to get him back
tywin	When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response?
cersei	You started a war
tywin	And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
cersei	Whatever you can
tywin	Whatever I can
tywin	Youre still here
cersei	Yes
tywin	Why?
cersei	Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me Years and years of lectures on family and legacy the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?
tywin	All right Contribute
cersei	The Tyrells are a problem
tywin	The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon The Tyrells saved your life, your childrens lives
cersei	Margaery has her claws in Joffrey She knows how to manipulate him
tywin	Good I wish you knew how to manipulate him I dont distrust you because youre a woman I distrust you because youre not as smart as you think you are Youve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city
cersei	Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes
tywin	I will
maid	Do you like it, Nana?
olenna	Another golden rose How original I eat from plates stamped with roses I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better Roses are boring, dear Growing strong Ha! The dullest words of any house Winter is coming! Now thats memorable We do not sow Strong Strong Those are houses you watch out for Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts But a golden rose growing strong ha, that strikes fear in the heart
olenna	Look, little loves A spider in the garden Run along now Grow strong
varys	My lady I wanted to personally welcome you to Kings Landing The city has been made brighter by your presence
olenna	The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?
varys	A little obvious, perhaps
olenna	Oh, no, please Seduce away Its been so long Though I rather think its all for naught What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers But youve come mincing all this way for something So?
varys	Might I sit?
olenna	No Come, Ive heard youre such a clever man Im curious why youve sought me out
varys	Youve taken an interest in Sansa Stark
olenna	Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldnt I take an interest? Shes an interesting girl
varys	Is she?
olenna	No, not particularly But shes had an interesting childhood
varys	She has, sadly Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being
olenna	Come, come You surrender rather easily Walk with me I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too
varys	I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still
olenna	Which is Sansa Stark?
varys	Neither A babe in the woods I admired her father
olenna	Yes Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
varys	I could not help Lord Stark Perhaps I can help his daughter
olenna	How?
varys	Youre not the only one who has taken an interest in her
olenna	Thats hardly surprising Shes a beautiful girl with a famous name
varys	Indeed Shed make a lovely match for the right suitor
olenna	It almost feels as if youre about to arrive at the point
varys	Littlefinger is not long for the capital A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him
olenna	And why have you come to me with this matter?
varys	Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies He has acquired the first two How long before he has the army?
varys	Perhaps youll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North
olenna	And if Littlefinger marries her, hell have the key in his pocket
varys	Which seems such a shame Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
olenna	You must despise him Youre working so hard to undermine him
varys	Actually, I rather enjoy him But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes
olenna	You are a clever man, Lord Varys
varys	You are too kind I believe I have a possible solution
olenna	One doesnt need to be clever for that Its all rather obvious, isnt it?
margaery	Ahem I didnt mean to disturb you
sansa	You havent
margaery	Wed like some privacy, please If you wouldnt mind waiting back inside the keep Or if youd be kind enough to give me your names, Ill ask the king to speak with you himself
margaery	What did you pray for?
sansa	I cant tell you
margaery	Why not? Ill tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning Lets see, for my familys health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter Boring and traditional, Im afraid And you?
sansa	Im sorry, I just cant
margaery	My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl Id ever seen When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me Pig-face, she called me
sansa	Pig-face? Thats ridiculous
margaery	I think it had something to do with my nose Whenever she passed me in the halls, shed oink
margaery	So I prayed that shed catch a horrible skin disease A week after that, she came down with porridge plague
sansa	Porridge plague?
margaery	You dont have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony
sansa	But thats awful
sansa	Youre I believed you! Porridge plague Im an idiot
margaery	Dont say that No, youre not
sansa	So what happened to Alanna?
margaery	Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea Its all terribly frustrating
sansa	Im sure shes jealous of you now Youll be married here in the capital and shell have to come watch and pretend to be happy that youre queen
margaery	I want us to be friends, good friends
sansa	That would make me very happy
margaery	You must see Highgarden Youd love it there I know you would We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon You should see the costumes People work on them for months
sansa	I I dont think the queen would let me leave Kings Landing
margaery	The Queen Regent, you mean Once I marry Joffrey, Ill be queen And if you were to marry Loras Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldnt it? We would be sisters, you and I Would you like that?

karl tanner	You are a bastard A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard
jeor	The gods will curse us for this By all the laws-
karl tanner	There are no laws beyond the Wall Now show us where he hides the food or youll get the same as he did
jeor	Unhand her
jeor	I shall have your head for this
sam	Quickly Quickly

arya	Ugh
thoros	Not easy finding molasses in wartime
gendry	Id have some
thoros	Lets go home
gendry	What is this place?
thoros	Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling
sandor	You look like a bunch of swineherds
anguy	Some of us were swineherds And some of us tanners and masons That was before
sandor	Youre still swineherds and tanners and masons You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
beric	No Fighting in a war makes you a soldier
sandor	Beric Dondarrion? Youve seen better days
beric	And I wont see them again
sandor	Stark deserters Baratheon deserters You lot arent fighting in a war Youre running from it
beric	Last I heard, you were King Joffreys guard dog But here you are 1000 miles from home Which of us is running?
sandor	Untie these ropes and well find out What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
beric	Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Roberts name
sandor	Ned Stark is dead King Robert is dead My brothers alive
sandor	Youre fighting for ghosts
beric	Thats what we are ghosts waiting for you in the dark You cant see us, but we see you No matter whose cloak you wear Lannister, Stark, Baratheon you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down
sandor	You found god? Is that it?
beric	Aye Ive been reborn in the light of the one true god As have we all As would any man whos seen the things weve seen
sandor	If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it
thoros	Youll die soon enough, dog But it wont be murder, only justice
anguy	And a kinder fate than you deserve Lions you call yourselves At the Mummers Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched
sandor	I wasnt at the Mummers Ford Dump your dead children at some other door
thoros	House Clegane was built upon dead children I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne
sandor	Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
anguy	Murder is a crime
sandor	I never touched the Targaryen babes I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But dont call me murderer and pretend that youre not
arya	You murdered Mycah The butchers boy My friend He was 12 years old He was unarmed And you rode him down You slung him over your horse like he was some deer
sandor	Aye, he was a bleeder
beric	You dont deny killing this boy?
sandor	I was Joffreys sworn shield The boy attacked the prince
arya	Thats a lie! I hit Joffrey Mycah just ran away
sandor	Then I should have killed you Not my place to question princes
beric	You stand accused of murder But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you Only the Lord of Light may do that now I sentence you to trial by combat
sandor	So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?
beric	Aye She might be But its me youll fight
missandei	The master says they are untested He says you would be wise to blood them early There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price
missandei	And who knows? In 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn Thus all shall prosper
daenerys	Is it done, then? They belong to me?
kraznys	It is done
missandei	It is done
kraznys	She holds the whip
missandei	You hold the whip
kraznys	The bitch has her army
daenerys	Unsullied
daenerys	Forward march
daenerys	Halt
kraznys	Tell the bitch her beast wont come
daenerys	A dragon is not a slave
kraznys	You speak Valyrian?
daenerys	I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria Valyrian is my mother tongue
daenerys	Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child Strike the chains off every slave you see
kraznys	I am your master
kraznys	Kill her! Kill her! Kill her
daenerys	Dracarys
daenerys	Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?
thoros	Lord, cast your light upon us
men	Lord of Light, defend us
thoros	Show us the truth Strike this man down if he is guilty Give strength to his sword if he is true Lord of Light, give us wisdom For the night is dark and full of terrors
