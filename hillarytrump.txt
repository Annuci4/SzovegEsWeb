HillaryClinton	A disability shouldn't define your future.
HillaryClinton	We believe that everyone has value.
HillaryClinton	We'll make our economy and country more welcoming to people with disabilities. We all win when everyone gets to share in America's promise.
HillaryClinton	The ultimate test of our society is how we treat our fellow human beings, especially those who we have previously left behind.
HillaryClinton	Americans with disabilities deserve the chance to work alongside those without disabilitiesâ€”to do the same jobs for the same pay &amp
HillaryClinton	Weâ€™ve got to build an economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect.
HillaryClinton	Over 60% of adults with disabilities arenâ€™t in the workplace. We have to fix that. https://t.co/J3Jq21ejtR
HillaryClinton	The ADA and the notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was one that Democrats and Republicans could both get behind.
HillaryClinton	None of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up.
HillaryClinton	One of Hillary's first jobs out of law school was to find out why kids with disabilities weren't in school. https://t.co/vPMCYQmbls
HillaryClinton	Not that long ago, if you had a disability, it defined your entire life. Basic, essential things that others could do, you couldnâ€™t.
HillaryClinton	It's still legal to pay disabled workers less than the minimum wage and Clinton announces her plan to end that:
HillaryClinton	Building an inclusive economy is another reason weâ€™ve got to break down systemic racism, including under-investment in communities of color.
HillaryClinton	When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.
HillaryClinton	In America, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.
HillaryClinton	We need to come together to turn the tide, stop violence, build trust, and give all our kids the chance to grow up safe and healthy.
HillaryClinton	We've also seen the targeting of police officersâ€”but so many serve every day with courage and honor and are committed to reform.
HillaryClinton	We have two names to add to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. Itâ€™s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.

HillaryClinton	What Trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. Apologize to the President, and to the American people.
HillaryClinton	Trumpâ€™s birtherism stems from the same innate beliefs that led to discriminating against black tenants early in his career. Can't be undone.
HillaryClinton	The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can't be unwritten.
HillaryClinton	Trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first African American president. He can't just take it back.
HillaryClinton	This shouldn't have to be said: You donâ€™t just get to say someone else did the worst things youâ€™ve done. It doesnâ€™t work. No one buys it.
HillaryClinton	Again, Trump turns his faults on others. Psychologists call it "projecting." Kids call it "I'm rubber, you're glue." https://t.co/lKDDD0wwsn

HillaryClinton	11. With business ties to politically-connected Indian developers, how can you conduct foreign policy that puts the U.S. above your profits?
HillaryClinton	10. How did the Russian mob boss who ran a criminal organization out of Trump Tower get a VIP pass to your Miss Universe pageant in Moscow?
HillaryClinton	9. Have you or your campaign discussed U.S.-Russian relations with the Russian billionaires with whom you've done business?
HillaryClinton	8. Will you disclose the nature of your personal and business relationships with all of the Russian oligarchs you are â€ścloseâ€ť to?

HillaryClinton	3. While refusing to release your tax returns, how will you confirm that you do not have dangerous financial ties to bad actors abroad?
HillaryClinton	2. How will you handle non-cancelable contractual obligations with parties whose interests conflict with those of the United States?
HillaryClinton	1. Will you sever ties with your company linked to foreign leaders, questionable organizations, and criminals if you become president?

HillaryClinton	Trump wants to eliminate the Estate Tax. It would save the Trump family $4 billion, but it would do nothing for 99.8% of Americans.
HillaryClinton	Trump's called for a new tax loopholeâ€”the Trump Loophole. He'd pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies.

realDonaldTrump	I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
realDonaldTrump	Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
realDonaldTrump	My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
realDonaldTrump	If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
realDonaldTrump	The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said

realDonaldTrump	I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!

realDonaldTrump	I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!

HillaryClinton	.@TimKaine is everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not: progressive and qualified to lead on day one. https://t.co/DBosbCSLcM
HillaryClinton	For more than a decade, @TimKaine's been leading the fight against the NRAâ€”right in their own backyard.
realDonaldTrump	Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp
realDonaldTrump	The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!

realDonaldTrump	The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp
realDonaldTrump	Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
realDonaldTrump	Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
HillaryClinton	People had some fun with a new game we invented: Sad! Libs. https://t.co/9jsm3Nc8cb
realDonaldTrump	If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
HillaryClinton	"Do all the good you canâ€”measure your life by the positive effect you can have on other peopleâ€™s lives." â€”@TimKaine https://t.co/f7iNc22nPU
realDonaldTrump	The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
realDonaldTrump	I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
realDonaldTrump	Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)

HillaryClinton	Trump, translated:
realDonaldTrump	Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
realDonaldTrump	There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
realDonaldTrump	An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
realDonaldTrump	Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
realDonaldTrump	Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
realDonaldTrump	Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
realDonaldTrump	The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
HillaryClinton	Your @GOP nominee for president has some thoughts on graphic design.
HillaryClinton	Our goal: 3 million people to register and commit to vote by Nov. 8

realDonaldTrump	HAPPY 241st BIRTHDAY to the @USArmy! THANK YOU! https://t.co/mXsxkfcstC
HillaryClinton	Today's #NetNeutrality decision is a big win for consumers, innovation, and freedom of expression on the internet: https://t.co/FcXI66zHDF
realDonaldTrump	Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.
HillaryClinton	This is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for those who look or love or worship one wayâ€”for all.
HillaryClinton	We need to work together to keep our country and our citizens safe.
HillaryClinton	People canâ€™t board planes with full shampoo bottlesâ€”but people being watched by the FBI for terrorism can buy a gun, no questions asked?
HillaryClinton	We need a Commander-in-Chief who can grapple with our challenges in all their complexity, with real plans that actually address them.
HillaryClinton	Trump's statements are liesâ€”but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
HillaryClinton	"He said Iâ€™ll abolish the 2nd Amendment. Wrong. He said Iâ€™ll let a flood of refugees into our country without any screening. Also wrong."
HillaryClinton	Trump's Muslim ban is wrong, dangerous, and in this instance, nonsensical. The terrorist in Orlando was born in Queensâ€”just like Donald.
HillaryClinton	"If Donald suggests I wonâ€™t call this threat what it is, he hasnâ€™t been listening. 
HillaryClinton	"It matters what we do, not just what we say. It didnâ€™t matter what we called bin Ladenâ€”it mattered that we got bin Laden." â€”Hillary
HillaryClinton	Americans donâ€™t need conspiracy theories and pathological self-congratulations. We need leadership, common sense, and concrete plans.
HillaryClinton	Trump's rhetoric is shameful.
HillaryClinton	People of different faiths, backgrounds, sexual orientations, and gender identities are coming together to say: we wonâ€™t let hate defeat us.
HillaryClinton	"I believe that despite those differences of opinion, weâ€™re all on the same team...Thereâ€™s more that unites us than divides us." â€”Hillary
HillaryClinton	"I believe we Americans are capable of protecting Second Amendment rights while making sure guns donâ€™t fall into the wrong hands." â€”Hillary
HillaryClinton	Yesterday, Trump spoke about the terrorist attack in Orlando.
HillaryClinton	LGBTQ people are Muslims, Jewish, black, Latino, women, immigrants. @realDonaldTrump's divisive rhetoric is wrong. Today especially so.
HillaryClinton	Gun violence prevention laws might not stop every shooting or terrorist attackâ€”but they will save lives. https://t.co/raNqMJ4ez8
HillaryClinton	â€śUn ataque a cualquier estadounidense, es un ataque a todos los estadounidensesâ€ť â€”Hillary tras tragedia en Orlando. https://t.co/EtTPn8stAe
realDonaldTrump	AMERICA FIRST!
realDonaldTrump	American must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.
HillaryClinton	If youâ€™re too dangerous to get on a plane, you're too dangerous to buy a gun in America. https://t.co/jTFExp1BXF
HillaryClinton	"I have no doubt we can meet this challengeâ€Šâ€”â€Šif we meet it together."
HillaryClinton	"A nightmare thatâ€™s become mind-numbingly familiar." 
realDonaldTrump	Join me in Atlanta on Wednesday- at noon! #Trump2016
HillaryClinton	Weapons of war like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino have no place on our streets.
HillaryClinton	Tenemos que unirnos, sentir orgullo juntos. No hay mejor respuesta para los terroristas y a todos aquellos que odian https://t.co/wQVmDQ321o
realDonaldTrump	Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on- cont'd: https://t.co/T1fVcu3mEC
realDonaldTrump	Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation- cont'd: https://t.co/t31ReRSzzy
realDonaldTrump	I thought people werenâ€™t celebrating? They were cheering all over, even this savage from Orlando. I was right. https://t.co/DrVa65X9rI
realDonaldTrump	In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.
realDonaldTrump	Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby:  https://t.co/THKJwjNkaz
realDonaldTrump	I am no fan of President Obama, but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is: https://t.co/cITm8BPixD
HillaryClinton	Our diversity isnâ€™t a liability in the fight against terrorism. Itâ€™s an asset. It makes us stronger. https://t.co/0cTpmfvA3c
realDonaldTrump	Anyone who plans to talk about Trump ever again has to see this speech.  Your opinion is irrelevant unless you listened to him today.
realDonaldTrump	TERRORISM, IMMIGRATION, AND NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH- TRANSCRIPT: https://t.co/WD1LGFKx3M https://t.co/T7yHSdCeU8
HillaryClinton	We have to stand together and be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate. https://t.co/jnFMG6J5Ac
realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to the 2016 #StanleyCup Champions, Pittsburgh @Penguins!
HillaryClinton	Our open, diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism, not a liability. It makes us stronger.
HillaryClinton	Weâ€™ve seen too many examples of the struggle to live freely, openly, and without fear being marked by violence. We have to stand together.
HillaryClinton	"To all the LGBT people grieving today: you have millions of allies who will always have your back. I am one of them." â€”Hillary
HillaryClinton	The terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry. 
HillaryClinton	Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. Itâ€™s wrong, and it's dangerous.
HillaryClinton	Background checks and an assault weapons ban might not stop every attackâ€”but they'll stop some, and save lives. We need to fight for them.
HillaryClinton	In Orlando and San Bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons like the AR-15 to kill Americans. We should make it harder for them to do so.
HillaryClinton	If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldnâ€™t be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.
HillaryClinton	We need to stop terrorists from getting the weapons they need to carry out attacks. https://t.co/Q6r7VVj9ds
HillaryClinton	"As president, I will make identifying and stopping lone wolves a top priority." â€”Hillary on her counterterrorism strategy
HillaryClinton	The murder of innocent people always breaks our hearts, scares us, and makes us furious. Now we have to steel our resolve and respond.
HillaryClinton	"They were sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and...they all had a lot more to give." â€”Hillary on the Orlando victims
HillaryClinton	Watch live: Hillary speaks on the terrorist attack in Orlando â†’ https://t.co/ARky5hVf9F
realDonaldTrump	I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @CNN, and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying
realDonaldTrump	I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M.
realDonaldTrump	I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!
HillaryClinton	"We cannot demonize, demagogue, and declare war on an entire religion...Hate is not the answer to hate." â€”Hillary
realDonaldTrump	What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
HillaryClinton	Declaraciones de Hillary Clinton sobre el ataque en Orlando. https://t.co/onc4230GUH
HillaryClinton	"This is a time to stand together and resolve to do everything we can to defend our communities and country." â€”Hillary on the attack in FL
HillaryClinton	"We need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals." â€”Hillary on the FL attack
HillaryClinton	"To the LGBT community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them.â€ť â€”Hillary https://t.co/MmaGjrSufr
realDonaldTrump	"@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.
HillaryClinton	"This was an act of terror. ... This was also an act of hate." â€”Hillary on the attack in Orlando https://t.co/MmaGjrSufr
HillaryClinton	"I join Americans in praying for the victims of the attack in Orlando." 
realDonaldTrump	Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.
realDonaldTrump	Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
realDonaldTrump	Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness &amp
realDonaldTrump	Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims &amp
HillaryClinton	DespertĂ© con la devastadora noticia de FL. Mientras esperamos mĂˇs informaciĂłn,mis pensamientos estĂˇn con los afectados de este horrible acto
realDonaldTrump	Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!
HillaryClinton	Woke up to hear the devastating news from FL. As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act. -H
realDonaldTrump	Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.
HillaryClinton	Donald Trump considers his shuttered casinos a success because HE made millions.
HillaryClinton	When Trump's casinos failed, he hurt a whole universe of small businesses that never got paid what they were owed. https://t.co/32cJxMhwnL
HillaryClinton	When Trump had to make an $18 million interest payment, his dad had to bail him out by buying $3 million in chips: https://t.co/w6e1LAjOlX

realDonaldTrump	Thank you Tampa, Florida!
HillaryClinton	When Trump goes off his staff's script he insults anyone who challenges him. Judge for his heritage, senator for hers. Rs should disavow. -H
realDonaldTrump	Sad case- @USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false, only don't pay when work is shoddy, bad, or not done! They should do same!
HillaryClinton	Trump University: Pad Donald's pockets and put your own finances at riskâ€”all for the low price of $35,000!

HillaryClinton	Weâ€™re not just going to break the glass ceiling. Weâ€™re going to break down all the barriers that hold back women and their families.
HillaryClinton	Trump has called women â€śpigs,â€ť â€śdogs,â€ť and â€śdisgusting animals.â€ť
HillaryClinton	Trump says he'd be "the best for women."
HillaryClinton	Laws that restrict access to abortion donâ€™t make women less likely to seek itâ€”they just make women less safe. https://t.co/vj4ZOeHq4V
HillaryClinton	Defending womenâ€™s health means defending access to safe, legal abortion for all who need itâ€”not just women who can afford it.
HillaryClinton	The Hyde Amendment restricts the reproductive rights of low-income womenâ€”disproportionately women of color. We need to repeal it now.
HillaryClinton	Ever notice the politicians who oppose birth control and abortion also oppose policies that make it easier to raise a childâ€”like paid leave?
HillaryClinton	â€śBeing able to plan their families not only saved womenâ€™s livesâ€”it also transformed them.â€ť â€”Hillary to @PPact

HillaryClinton	Trump prioritizing his own gain over Americans' well-being isn't new, but it is telling: The only person he'll fight for is himself.

HillaryClinton	62 reasons why Donald Trump should never become president (from members of his own party). https://t.co/0gYEctRjSe
realDonaldTrump	Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
realDonaldTrump	Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
HillaryClinton	@JLo thanks for this. Women are so much more than the roles they've been assigned. -H
realDonaldTrump	Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
realDonaldTrump	Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
realDonaldTrump	Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clintonâ€™s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
realDonaldTrump	Letâ€™s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s records to see if she is Native American. I say sheâ€™s a fraud!
realDonaldTrump	I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
HillaryClinton	Substance abuse and drug addiction hurt our kids, friends, neighbors, and loved ones. We've got to solve this.

realDonaldTrump	Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!

realDonaldTrump	Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

realDonaldTrump	Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.

realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!
realDonaldTrump	Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.
realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.
realDonaldTrump	Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
realDonaldTrump	Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!

realDonaldTrump	Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

realDonaldTrump	Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!
realDonaldTrump	Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

realDonaldTrump	Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!

realDonaldTrump	So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

realDonaldTrump	Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies."
realDonaldTrump	Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
realDonaldTrump	The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
realDonaldTrump	This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud https://t.co/tRM7KUCrSU
realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
realDonaldTrump	Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
realDonaldTrump	And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
realDonaldTrump	The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
realDonaldTrump	Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
realDonaldTrump	During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
realDonaldTrump	Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN

realDonaldTrump	The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!

realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
realDonaldTrump	Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
realDonaldTrump	Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
realDonaldTrump	The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
realDonaldTrump	Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

realDonaldTrump	If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isnâ€™t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who canâ€™t win.
realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. https://t.co/DL8hDPzHoi
realDonaldTrump	Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...

realDonaldTrump	In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
realDonaldTrump	Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!
realDonaldTrump	"@redletter99: Trump pummels his opponents - and the press | SunHerald @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/9MQhOSpiWa"  Thank you!

realDonaldTrump	Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!
realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!
realDonaldTrump	I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!
realDonaldTrump	(2/2) David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it! 
realDonaldTrump	(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.
realDonaldTrump	Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. https://t.co/2DZp7YOadj https://t.co/2YtLlEwceB
realDonaldTrump	.@JonahNRO, watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements --- I have been waiting for them for a long time. Thank you.
realDonaldTrump	Thank you, @TheFix- Chris Cillizza. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion &amp
realDonaldTrump	Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says "wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).
realDonaldTrump	South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!
realDonaldTrump	Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!
realDonaldTrump	Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5,000 turned away. Thank you for coming!
realDonaldTrump	Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd! Will be wild.
realDonaldTrump	#FoxNews Poll - THANK YOU!

realDonaldTrump	On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!
realDonaldTrump	Not good news for Jeb Bush  https://t.co/5CrP5zdXsz
realDonaldTrump	Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!
realDonaldTrump	"@rlbenney: @realDonaldTrump You did great and showed courage going to Burlington. No other GOP candidate would do what you did tonight!"
realDonaldTrump	"@pink_sprnva: @pastormike7 @thehill I agree with you on this. @realDonaldTrump won't be good. He will be great!"

realDonaldTrump	Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.
realDonaldTrump	We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! https://t.co/NHPdGm57YJ
realDonaldTrump	I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!
realDonaldTrump	Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!
realDonaldTrump	The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!
realDonaldTrump	Explosive Trump attack on HRC, Bill, Monica, Cosby, and Weiner. Trump camp just upped the ante on "women's rights" https://t.co/tTBhyX4EDJ
realDonaldTrump	Hillary and her friends! https://t.co/q45tTapqMI
realDonaldTrump	Weak &amp
realDonaldTrump	I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!
realDonaldTrump	.@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now &amp
realDonaldTrump	Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!
realDonaldTrump	Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!
realDonaldTrump	I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
realDonaldTrump	It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
realDonaldTrump	.@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp
realDonaldTrump	The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!
realDonaldTrump	Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: https://t.co/NucdHBZAH9
realDonaldTrump	I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.
realDonaldTrump	Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!
realDonaldTrump	Donâ€™t like @SamuelLJacksonâ€™s golf swing.  Not athletic. Iâ€™ve won many club championships. Play him for charity!
realDonaldTrump	I donâ€™t cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheatsâ€”with his game he has no choiceâ€”and stop doing commercials!
realDonaldTrump	HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you!
realDonaldTrump	Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!
